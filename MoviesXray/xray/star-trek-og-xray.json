The probe had been made vastly more powerful by an encounter with an alien probe and the two merged into one, enabling it to fire incredibly powerful energy bolts at targets in its path as it attempted to sterilize \"imperfect biological infestations\" (i.e. all living creatures, including people), but had difficulty accepting that humans were its \"creator\". The story was adapted again in the 1970s by Gene Roddenberry for an unproduced television series of his called Genesis II (1973), in an episode called \"Robot's Return\". This was then re-written as a Star Trek script by Alan Dean Foster under the title \"In Thy Image\", and proposed as the two-hour premiere episode of \"Star Trek: Phase II\" (a planned Star Trek television series that actually started production in 1977). However, Paramount decided to abandon the idea for another television series and make a Star Trek film instead, and the story was adapted for Star Trek: The Motion Picture (1979).","QUATERNARY":"Starts at 01:57:05","SECONDARY":"General Trivia","TERTIARY":"Scene 42"},"type":"relatedCollectionBlueprintedItem","version":1},{"__type":"RelatedCollectionBlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":null,"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayTriviaItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/title/tt0079945/trivia/tr0742587","imageMap":null,"linkActionMap":{"SECONDARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_x_triv_jump_84"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"player","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"timecode":"7331000"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":"Jump to Scene","type":"navigational","version":1}},"relatedCollection":{"__type":"ItemsV2:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","itemList":[{"__type":"BlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":{"PRIMARY":"William Shatner"},"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayPersonItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/name/nm0000638/","imageMap":{"PRIMARY":{"alternateText":null,"gradientRequired":false,"size":{"unit":"px","x":299,"y":400},"url":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjI3NjUzOTEzMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTMyMTA3Mw@@._V1_.jpg","version":1}},"linkActionMap":{"PRIMARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_x_triv_rnm_0"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"xray","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"pageId":"actorDetail","pageType":"xray","serviceToken":"{\"consumptionType\":\"Streaming\",\"deviceClass\":\"normal\",\"itemId\":\"/name/nm0000638/\",\"playbackMode\":\"playback\",\"vcid\":\"9031100\"}","widgetId":"actorDetail_/name/nm0000638/"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":null,"type":"navigational","version":1}},"textMap":null,"type":"blueprintedItem","version":1},{"__type":"BlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":{"PRIMARY":"Leonard Nimoy"},"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayPersonItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/name/nm0000559/","imageMap":{"PRIMARY":{"alternateText":null,"gradientRequired":false,"size":{"unit":"px","x":292,"y":400},"url":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTIzMzY1MzEyNV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNjU4MTg1._V1_.jpg","version":1}},"linkActionMap":{"PRIMARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_x_triv_rnm_1"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"xray","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"pageId":"actorDetail","pageType":"xray","serviceToken":"{\"consumptionType\":\"Streaming\",\"deviceClass\":\"normal\",\"itemId\":\"/name/nm0000559/\",\"playbackMode\":\"playback\",\"vcid\":\"9031100\"}","widgetId":"actorDetail_/name/nm0000559/"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":null,"type":"navigational","version":1}},"textMap":null,"type":"blueprintedItem","version":1}],"maxItems":0,"paginationLink":null,"version":2},"textMap":{"PRIMARY":"Post-production went on right up until the day before the film's world premiere.

Shatner claims that by the time he pitched the ending to Roddenberry that he was so exhausted from mustering up the energy to pitch the idea (in addition to the energy he use to work on the film) that his pitch did not go over so well and Gene Roddenberry rejected it. In his book \"Star Trek Movie Memories\" (1994), Shatner recalls the story differently: the scene in question is the one in which the Enterprise crew starts to leave the bridge in order to show the Ilia probe it is acting like a little child. When Roddenberry rejected it, Robert Wise got Harold Livingston to write the scene instead.","SECONDARY":"General Trivia"},"type":"blueprintedItem","version":1}},{"id":"/title/tt0079945/goofs/gf0864105","item":{"__type":"BlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":null,"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayFactQuickviewItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/title/tt0079945/goofs/gf0864105","imageMap":null,"linkActionMap":{"PRIMARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_b_bbl_triv"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"xray","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"itemId":"/title/tt0079945/goofs/gf0864105","pageId":"fullScreen","pageType":"xray","serviceToken":"{\"consumptionType\":\"Streaming\",\"deviceClass\":\"normal\",\"playbackMode\":\"playback\",\"vcid\":\"9031100\"}","widgetId":"triviaTab_9031100"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":null,"type":"navigational","version":1}},"textMap":{"PRIMARY":"Continuity: In several shots of the Enterprise throughout, we plainly see a pair of phaser turrets just below \"U.S.S.

The story was adapted again in the 1970s by Gene Roddenberry for an unproduced television series of his called Genesis II (1973), in an episode called \"Robot's Return\". This was then re-written as a Star Trek script by Alan Dean Foster under the title \"In Thy Image\", and proposed as the two-hour premiere episode of \"Star Trek: Phase II\" (a planned Star Trek television series that actually started production in 1977).
