the wardrobe department was looking for a coat for Frank Morgan (Prof. Marvel / The Wizard), it decided it wanted one that looked like it had once been elegant but had since \"gone to seed.\" They visited a second-hand store and purchased an entire rack of coats, from which Morgan, the head of the wardrobe department and director Victor Fleming chose one they felt gave off the perfect appearance of \"shabby gentility.\" One day, while he was on set in the coat, Morgan idly turned out one of the pockets and discovered a label indicating that the coat had been made for L.

According to a letter from Fields' agent (which he claimed was written by Fields), Fields turned down the role to devote his time to writing the script for You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939). Since the role was perceived as being too small, additional roles were written for the actor in hopes of balancing the screen time for the actor playing the Wizard with that of the rest of the cast. Thus Frank Morgan plays the roles of the Wizard, Professor Marvel, the Gatekeeper, the cab driver with the \"horse of a different color\" who performs a musical number and the Wizard's Guard.

This process--cumbersome, expensive and ineffective--was abandoned in favor of a simpler and more clever alternative (a variation of this process was used, however, in 1939 release prints of The Women (1939)). The inside of the farmhouse was painted sepia, and the Dorothy who opens the door from the inside is not Judy Garland but her stand-in wearing a sepia-rinsed version of the famous gingham dress. Once the door is opened and the camera advances through it, Garland (wearing her bright blue dress) walks through the door and the audience is none the wiser. This effect does not work on older video/TV prints where the Kansas scenes appear in true black and white, as the changeover to color is all too apparent. With the Kansas scenes returned to their original sepia tints, however, they closely match the magical opening door and the effect is powerful.","QUATERNARY":"Starts at 00:19:28","SECONDARY":"General Trivia","TERTIARY":"Scene 12"},"type":"relatedCollectionBlueprintedItem","version":1},{"__type":"RelatedCollectionBlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":null,"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayTriviaItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0781763","imageMap":null,"linkActionMap":{"SECONDARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_x_triv_jump_28"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"player","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"timecode":"1203000"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":"Jump to Scene","type":"navigational","version":1}},"relatedCollection":{"__type":"ItemsV2:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","itemList":[{"__type":"BlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":{"PRIMARY":"Judy Garland"},"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayPersonItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/name/nm0000023/","imageMap":{"PRIMARY":{"alternateText":null,"gradientRequired":false,"size":{"unit":"px","x":357,"y":450},"url":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTYwMTQ0ODMxNF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwNDY2MjU2._V1_.jpg","version":1}},"linkActionMap":{"PRIMARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_x_triv_rnm_0"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"xray","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"pageId":"actorDetail","pageType":"xray","serviceToken":"{\"consumptionType\":\"Streaming\",\"deviceClass\":\"normal\",\"itemId\":\"/name/nm0000023/\",\"playbackMode\":\"playback\",\"vcid\":\"11662152300\"}","widgetId":"actorDetail_/name/nm0000023/"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":null,"type":"navigational","version":1}},"textMap":null,"type":"blueprintedItem","version":1}],"maxItems":0,"paginationLink":null,"version":2},"textMap":{"PRIMARY":"Judy Garland had to wear a painful corset-style device around her torso so that she would appear younger and flat-chested, as she was 16 years old at the time of filming, playing the role of a pre-adolescent child.","QUATERNARY":"Starts at 00:20:03","SECONDARY":"General Trivia","TERTIARY":"Scene 12"},"type":"relatedCollectionBlueprintedItem","version":1},{"__type":"BlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":null,"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayTriviaItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0781729","imageMap":null,"linkActionMap":{"SECONDARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_x_triv_jump_29"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"player","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"timecode":"1237000"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":"Jump to Scene","type":"navigational","version":1}},"textMap":{"PRIMARY":"The House of Winston made a pair of real ruby slippers to celebrate the film's 50th anniversary in 1989.

The deal, however, was voided by Harlow's untimely death. This story is apocryphal, as Harlow died on June 7, 1937, and MGM did not purchase the right's to \"Oz\" until February 18, 1938. Futhermore, Temple's vocal talents were deemed by producers Mervyn LeRoy and Arthur Freed to be inadequate for the scope of the role.

Bolger was originally cast as the Tin Man. However, he insisted that he would rather play the Scarecrow--his childhood idol Fred Stone had originated that role on stage in 1902. Buddy Ebsen had been cast as the Scarecrow, and now switched roles with Bolger. Unbeknownst to him, however, the make-up for the Tin Man contained aluminum dust, which ended up coating Ebsen's lungs. He also had an allergic reaction to it. One day he was physically unable to breathe and had to be rushed to hospital. The part was immediately recast and MGM gave no public reason why Ebsen was being replaced. The actor considered this the biggest humiliation he ever endured and a personal affront. When Jack Haley took over the part of the Tin Man, he wasn't told why Ebsen had dropped out (and in the meantime, the Tin Man make-up was changed from aluminum dust to aluminum paste as one of its key components). However, his vocals remain whenever the song \"We're off to see the Wizard\" is played. Jack Haley's vocals were never used during the song, but were used for \"If I Only Had a Heart\" and \"If I Only Had the Nerve.\" Ebsen's vocals are also heard in the extended version of \"If I were King of the Forest,\" though the spoken segment has Jack Haley. Although no Ebsen footage from the film has ever been released, surviving still photos show him taking part in the Wicked Witch's castle sequence.","QUATERNARY":"Starts at

Thorpe, the film's original director, had shot around two weeks of footage before he was fired. Among the scenes he shot were Dorothy's meeting of the Scarecrow on the Yellow Brick Road along with his song and dance, as well as all the scenes involving the Wicked Witch's castle. Thorpe's footage had a remarkably different look from what was seen in the finished film. Most striking was the look of Judy Garland's Dorothy, who in Thorpe's footage had a blonde tousled hairstyle with baby doll make-up. Ray Bolger's Scarecrow also had different make-up, as well as trousers. Margaret Hamilton had different make-up as the Wicked Witch of the West. In addition, Buddy Ebsen was playing the Tin Man. In Thorpe's footage the Yellow Brick Road also had a different look, as it was not curbed and made up of artificial-looking oval bricks, instead of the curbed real rectangular ones in the finished film. Thorpe's footage has not been seen since it was shot in 1938 but surviving home movies, taken by composer Harold Arlen, shows a few shots of a blonde Garland and Bolger rehearsing their Scarecrow meeting scene, giving the viewer a glimpse of what Thorpe's Oz would have looked like.","QUATERNARY":"Starts at 01:37:04","SECONDARY":"General Trivia","TERTIARY":"Scene 41"},"type":"relatedCollectionBlueprintedItem","version":1},{"__type":"RelatedCollectionBlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":null,"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayTriviaItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0782028","imageMap":null,"linkActionMap":{"SECONDARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_x_triv_jump_150"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"player","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"timecode":"5859000"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":"Jump to Scene","type":"navigational","version":1}},"relatedCollection":{"__type":"ItemsV2:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","itemList":[{"__type":"BlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":{"PRIMARY":"Mervyn LeRoy"},"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayPersonItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/name/nm0503777/","imageMap":{"PRIMARY":{"alternateText":null,"gradientRequired":false,"size":{"unit":"px","x":450,"y":358},"url":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTMyODc2NTkwOV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTYwMjA2MjI2._V1_.jpg","version":1}},"linkActionMap":{"PRIMARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_x_triv_rnm_0"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"xray","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"pageId":"actorDetail","pageType":"xray","serviceToken":"{\"consumptionType\":\"Streaming\",\"deviceClass\":\"normal\",\"itemId\":\"/name/nm0503777/\",\"playbackMode\":\"playback\",\"vcid\":\"11662152300\"}","widgetId":"actorDetail_/name/nm0503777/"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":null,"type":"navigational","version":1}},"textMap":null,"type":"blueprintedItem","version":1},{"__type":"BlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":{"PRIMARY":"Bert Lahr"},"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayPersonItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/name/nm0481618/","imageMap":{"PRIMARY":{"alternateText":null,"gradientRequired":false,"size":{"unit":"px","x":839,"y":1279},"url":"https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjcyNTY2MDgwMF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNjM3ODIyOA@@._V1_.jpg","version":1}},"linkActionMap":{"PRIMARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_x_triv_rnm_1"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"xray","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"pageId":"actorDetail","pageType":"xray","serviceToken":"{\"consumptionType\":\"Streaming\",\"deviceClass\":\"normal\",\"itemId\":\"/name/nm0481618/\",\"playbackMode\":\"playback\",\"vcid\":\"11662152300\"}","widgetId":"actorDetail_/name/nm0481618/"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":null,"type":"navigational","version":1}},"textMap":null,"type":"blueprintedItem","version":1}],"maxItems":0,"paginationLink":null,"version":2},"textMap":{"PRIMARY":"Producer Mervyn LeRoy had originally intended to use MGM's Jackie the Lion in the role of the Cowardly Lion and dub an actor's voice in for the dialogue.

According to a letter from Fields' agent (which he claimed was written by Fields), Fields turned down the role to devote his time to writing the script for You Can't Cheat an Honest Man (1939). Since the role was perceived as being too small, additional roles were written for the actor in hopes of balancing the screen time for the actor playing the Wizard with that of the rest of the cast. Thus Frank Morgan plays the roles of the Wizard, Professor Marvel, the Gatekeeper, the cab driver with the \"horse of a different color\" who performs a musical number and the Wizard's Guard.

This process--cumbersome, expensive and ineffective--was abandoned in favor of a simpler and more clever alternative (a variation of this process was used, however, in 1939 release prints of The Women (1939)). The inside of the farmhouse was painted sepia, and the Dorothy who opens the door from the inside is not Judy Garland but her stand-in wearing a sepia-rinsed version of the famous gingham dress. Once the door is opened and the camera advances through it, Garland (wearing her bright blue dress) walks through the door and the audience is none the wiser. This effect does not work on older video/TV prints where the Kansas scenes appear in true black and white, as the changeover to color is all too apparent. With the Kansas scenes returned to their original sepia tints, however, they closely match the magical opening door and the effect is powerful.","SECONDARY":"General Trivia"},"type":"blueprintedItem","version":1}},{"id":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0781763","item":{"__type":"BlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":null,"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayFactQuickviewItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0781763","imageMap":null,"linkActionMap":{"PRIMARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_b_bbl_triv"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"xray","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"itemId":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0781763","pageId":"fullScreen","pageType":"xray","serviceToken":"{\"consumptionType\":\"Streaming\",\"deviceClass\":\"normal\",\"playbackMode\":\"playback\",\"vcid\":\"11662152300\"}","widgetId":"triviaTab_11662152300"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":null,"type":"navigational","version":1}},"textMap":{"PRIMARY":"Judy Garland had to wear a painful corset-style device around her torso so that she would appear younger and flat-chested, as she was 16 years old at the time of filming, playing the role of a pre-adolescent child.","SECONDARY":"General Trivia"},"type":"blueprintedItem","version":1}},{"id":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0781729","item":{"__type":"BlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":null,"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayFactQuickviewItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0781729","imageMap":null,"linkActionMap":{"PRIMARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_b_bbl_triv"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"xray","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"itemId":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0781729","pageId":"fullScreen","pageType":"xray","serviceToken":"{\"consumptionType\":\"Streaming\",\"deviceClass\":\"normal\",\"playbackMode\":\"playback\",\"vcid\":\"11662152300\"}","widgetId":"triviaTab_11662152300"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":null,"type":"navigational","version":1}},"textMap":{"PRIMARY":"The House of Winston made a pair of real ruby slippers to celebrate the film's 50th anniversary in 1989.

An entire book was published with trivia and history of the numerous test styles: \"The Ruby Slippers of Oz\" by Rhys Thomas (Tale Weaver Publishers, 1989).

He also had an allergic reaction to it. One day he was physically unable to breathe and had to be rushed to hospital. The part was immediately recast and MGM gave no public reason why Ebsen was being replaced. The actor considered this the biggest humiliation he ever endured and a personal affront. When Jack Haley took over the part of the Tin Man, he wasn't told why Ebsen had dropped out (and in the meantime, the Tin Man make-up was changed from aluminum dust to aluminum paste as one of its key components). However, his vocals remain whenever the song \"We're off to see the Wizard\" is played. Jack Haley's vocals were never used during the song, but were used for \"If I Only Had a Heart\" and \"If I Only Had the Nerve.\" Ebsen's vocals are also heard in the extended version of \"If I were King of the Forest,\" though the spoken segment has Jack Haley.

Among the scenes he shot were Dorothy's meeting of the Scarecrow on the Yellow Brick Road along with his song and dance, as well as all the scenes involving the Wicked Witch's castle. Thorpe's footage had a remarkably different look from what was seen in the finished film. Most striking was the look of Judy Garland's Dorothy, who in Thorpe's footage had a blonde tousled hairstyle with baby doll make-up. Ray Bolger's Scarecrow also had different make-up, as well as trousers. Margaret Hamilton had different make-up as the Wicked Witch of the West. In addition, Buddy Ebsen was playing the Tin Man. In Thorpe's footage the Yellow Brick Road also had a different look, as it was not curbed and made up of artificial-looking oval bricks, instead of the curbed real rectangular ones in the finished film. Thorpe's footage has not been seen since it was shot in 1938 but surviving home movies, taken by composer Harold Arlen, shows a few shots of a blonde Garland and Bolger rehearsing their Scarecrow meeting scene, giving the viewer a glimpse of what Thorpe's Oz would have looked like.","SECONDARY":"General Trivia"},"type":"blueprintedItem","version":1}},{"id":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0782028","item":{"__type":"BlueprintedItem:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","accessibilityMap":null,"analytics":null,"blueprint":{"id":"XrayFactQuickviewItem"},"debugAttributes":null,"id":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0782028","imageMap":null,"linkActionMap":{"PRIMARY":{"__type":"NavigationalAction:http://internal.amazon.com/coral/com.amazon.atv.discovery/","analytics":{"cascade":null,"local":{"refMarker":"atv_plr_b_bbl_triv"}},"cacheKey":null,"linkType":"xray","nonSupportedText":null,"parameters":{"itemId":"/title/tt0032138/trivia/tr0782028","pageId":"fullScreen","pageType":"xray","serviceToken":"{\"consumptionType\":\"Streaming\",\"deviceClass\":\"normal\",\"playbackMode\":\"playback\",\"vcid\":\"11662152300\"}","widgetId":"triviaTab_11662152300"},"prefetchPolicy":null,"text":null,"type":"navigational","version":1}},"textMap":{"PRIMARY":"Producer Mervyn LeRoy had originally intended to use MGM's Jackie the Lion in the role of the Cowardly Lion and dub an actor's voice in for the dialogue.

After this preview LeRoy cut the aforementioned Jitterbug number and the Scarecrow's extended dance sequence to \"If I Only Had a Brain.\" A second preview was held in Pomona, where the film ran 112 minutes. After the preview LeRoy cut Dorothy's \"Over The Rainbow\" reprise, a scene in which the Tin Man turned into a human beehive, and the Emerald City reprise of \"Ding Dong, The Witch is Dead,\" as well as a few smaller scenes and dialog, notably two Kansas scenes in which the Hickory character was building a machine to ward off tornadoes, as well as dozens of threatening lines by the Wicked Witch of the West.
