8/9/16, 6:16:10 PM: Linda Zheng: If you happen to run into Kyle or deric can you pick up packages again? But it's past 6 so they most likely won't be there
8/9/16, 6:16:17 PM: Linda Zheng: Thanks!!!
8/9/16, 6:22:32 PM: Sean Reardon: Ha, otay
8/9/16, 6:28:46 PM: Sean Reardon: Did not see them.
8/9/16, 6:28:59 PM: Sean Reardon: I wish you'd ordered internet today...
8/9/16, 6:40:33 PM: Linda Zheng: Aw sorry

8/10/16, 5:58:27 PM: Sean Reardon: Kicking ass today?
8/10/16, 5:58:34 PM: Linda Zheng: Not really :/
8/10/16, 5:58:39 PM: Linda Zheng: Wrote unit tests
8/10/16, 5:58:50 PM: Linda Zheng: But other things broke
8/10/16, 5:59:01 PM: Sean Reardon: Those pay themselves back so many times over.  But can be boring to write.
8/10/16, 5:59:19 PM: Sean Reardon: Did you get any more api feedback?
8/10/16, 6:00:01 PM: Linda Zheng: Still not approved lol. But doesn't really matter since it's mostly just a formality
8/10/16, 6:00:30 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah easy enough to change some variable names
8/10/16, 6:01:37 PM: Linda Zheng: Lol my tech lead guy told me to go home.  So I think I will since everything is broken and we don't know why
8/10/16, 6:05:59 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah fuck it.  Thank god it's Friday
8/10/16, 6:06:24 PM: Linda Zheng: Both android and iPhone were fully charged this morning, I used iPhone wayyyy more than android, as in android was not used at all other than music in the car and sending 1 text. And iPhone has 81% while android has 80.
8/10/16, 6:07:18 PM: Sean Reardon: Doing movie at 1010 with dad and mark
8/10/16, 6:07:53 PM: Linda Zheng: Lolol that doesn't help!! That just makes one more disappointed that reality is worse than expectations! "Fuck it's Monday" should be the slogan
8/10/16, 6:08:46 PM: Linda Zheng: Okay have fun!
8/11/16, 10:20:08 AM: Sean Reardon: Get internet!

8/11/16, 12:38:42 PM: Sean Reardon: On one hand, sorry for coming home drunk like that.  On the other hand, was so fun to sneak into a girls place while she was naked and asleep, and watch her sleep for a moment before she startled!
8/11/16, 1:09:34 PM: Linda Zheng: Lol no worries! I remember having fun! Like when you kissed my body and it tickled me :)

8/11/16, 8:02:22 PM: Linda Zheng: what’s your body fat %?
8/12/16, 6:40:23 AM: Sean Reardon: Guess I'm staying at my place last night.  Huh!
8/12/16, 6:40:36 AM: Sean Reardon: Think it's like 13%?
8/12/16, 10:22:56 AM: Linda Zheng: Lol
8/12/16, 10:31:03 AM: Linda Zheng: Wait now I only have like 700 calories per day, but earlier, I had like 1000
8/12/16, 10:31:24 AM: Linda Zheng: I'm so confused by this app and goal setting
8/12/16, 10:31:38 AM: Sean Reardon: Maybe it's trying to hit a particular weight goal?
8/12/16, 10:31:41 AM: Sean Reardon: YeahH
8/12/16, 10:31:56 AM: Linda Zheng: It is, but I also set a body fat % goal
8/12/16, 10:32:38 AM: Linda Zheng: Like when I just set a body fat goal, I get 1000 calories. But when I do weight goal, it only gives me like 700 :(

8/12/16, 2:32:12 PM: Linda Zheng: Wow nice! But it seems modern to the point of impeding on usability
8/12/16, 2:32:31 PM: Linda Zheng: Mostly the knife though
8/12/16, 3:20:09 PM: Sean Reardon: You're both modern and usable
8/12/16, 3:40:19 PM: Linda Zheng: Fatty got moved to front end / ui since I did all the backend myself, so now she's learning JavaScript and I have to write the documentation :(

8/15/16, 12:19:41 PM: Sean Reardon: Would be fun you see you try out your goggles more.
8/15/16, 12:19:53 PM: Linda Zheng: Okay!
8/15/16, 12:21:27 PM: Sean Reardon: Apparently I already discovered the fastest money making trick in nms, haha
8/15/16, 12:21:38 PM: Sean Reardon: Sometimes I'm Jewish
8/15/16, 12:22:10 PM: Linda Zheng: Lol the Nickle thing you did yesterday?
8/15/16, 12:23:55 PM: Sean Reardon: Nope.  You take the two most common elements, make a simple device out of them for not much of those resources, and sell it for hundreds of times markup of those component values
8/15/16, 12:24:09 PM: Sean Reardon: Basically like shrimp
8/15/16, 12:47:17 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahahaha has
8/15/16, 4:35:24 PM: Linda Zheng: What time should we go swimming?
8/15/16, 4:49:12 PM: Sean Reardon: I dunno!  are you super tired today?  we don't have to go super late, but if we go earlier there are more people.
8/15/16, 4:49:35 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh ew people.
8/15/16, 4:50:12 PM: Linda Zheng: Maybe we can hang out at my place for a bit after work, then go swimming, then go your place? Make our way south! Haha
8/15/16, 5:21:50 PM: Sean Reardon: encroach!
8/15/16, 6:09:49 PM: Linda Zheng: Um how does one know if ones side view Mirrors are correct?
8/15/16, 6:21:54 PM: Sean Reardon: can you define correct?
8/15/16, 6:22:58 PM: Sean Reardon: what I try to do is line it up such that about 10% of the mirror is spent on the car itself.  that way you're reasonably sure that you seeing everything from the car out, rather than having a gap between world and car that you're not seeing.  and 10% gives me some wiggle room to lean on way or another.
8/15/16, 6:34:53 PM: Linda Zheng: Thanks! Mine were not correct
8/15/16, 6:53:18 PM: Sean Reardon: glad to help!

8/15/16, 7:44:19 PM: Linda Zheng: Please do!
8/15/16, 7:44:35 PM: Linda Zheng: We don't have to be so clingy :P
8/15/16, 7:44:54 PM: Linda Zheng: I'll let you know when I'm done!
8/15/16, 7:50:36 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah it's not like we're married

8/15/16, 8:53:14 PM: Sean Reardon: What's that???
8/15/16, 8:53:25 PM: Linda Zheng: I went to the trash room!!!!

8/16/16, 11:14:35 AM: Sean Reardon: Same! That was dreamy wonderful
8/16/16, 11:47:38 AM: Sean Reardon: Oh god I met your parents in a dream last night.  It was some family-on-family going out to dinner thing.
8/16/16, 11:48:32 AM: Sean Reardon: I felt awkward and super focused on both of your parents.  But ultimately totally confident, to the point of being assertive, if not outright aggressive, because "the lady had made her choice"
8/16/16, 11:59:10 AM: Sean Reardon: Coot coot.  Lunch time is when you have a break from work and can run personal errands
8/16/16, 11:59:18 AM: Sean Reardon: I've emailed my tax guy!
8/16/16, 11:59:31 AM: Sean Reardon: I've started my process.

8/22/16, 12:32:09 PM: Linda Zheng: How was your night?
8/22/16, 12:32:38 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh, except I cut my hand and cried about that for a bit lol
8/22/16, 12:32:42 PM: Sean Reardon: Was fine.  Went to a wine bar and it ended up having jazz!
8/22/16, 12:32:47 PM: Sean Reardon: Lol got jazz anyway
8/22/16, 12:32:50 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh yay!
8/22/16, 12:33:21 PM: Linda Zheng: Were the hey ren good?
8/22/16, 12:35:40 PM: Sean Reardon: They were energetic!
8/22/16, 12:35:55 PM: Sean Reardon: And it was nice just chilling with wine rather than cocktails
8/22/16, 12:36:22 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh nice!
8/22/16, 12:36:35 PM: Linda Zheng: Which do you prefer?
8/22/16, 12:36:40 PM: Sean Reardon: How's your glass cut?
8/22/16, 12:36:53 PM: Sean Reardon: Variety is the spice of life
8/22/16, 12:37:00 PM: Sean Reardon: What glass?
8/22/16, 12:37:31 PM: Linda Zheng: It's fine lol. It was a small cut, but bled a lot initially, which made me have some panic. But nbd
8/22/16, 12:38:01 PM: Sean Reardon: You for sure panicked!  There's no way you didn't, haha
8/22/16, 12:38:10 PM: Sean Reardon: Can't wait to kiss it better
8/22/16, 12:38:41 PM: Linda Zheng: Not actually glass. But one of the lights broke and I didn't see that it was broken when I grabbed it lol
8/22/16, 12:38:50 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh ouch!!!

8/25/16, 11:50:20 AM: Sean Reardon: But I also need to stay at my place tonight to do laundry:(
8/25/16, 11:56:07 AM: Linda Zheng: Okay!! Couch at mine, then laundry and sleep at yours?
8/25/16, 12:02:33 PM: Linda Zheng: Or I guess we could sleep separately and not be clingy :(
8/25/16, 12:30:20 PM: Linda Zheng: Sean, I think in order to lose fat, we need to get muscles!
8/25/16, 1:11:30 PM: Sean Reardon: couch at your place, sleeps at mine, yep!
8/25/16, 1:11:43 PM: Sean Reardon: no!  to lose fat you just eat less.  I've lost 11 lbs
8/25/16, 1:13:13 PM: Linda Zheng: You've lost weight!
8/25/16, 1:13:20 PM: Linda Zheng: I want to lose fat
8/25/16, 1:13:29 PM: Linda Zheng: Once you have muscles, they will eat the fat
8/25/16, 1:16:09 PM: Sean Reardon: if you don't have muscles, all the weight you lose is fat.
8/25/16, 1:16:09 PM: Sean Reardon: or hair
8/25/16, 1:16:19 PM: Sean Reardon: people are:  bone, muscle, fat, and hair
8/25/16, 1:16:58 PM: Sean Reardon: how do you want to get muscles?  rock climbing sounded fun to you!
8/25/16, 1:18:59 PM: Linda Zheng: But you want muscles!
8/25/16, 1:19:14 PM: Linda Zheng: *one wants
8/25/16, 1:19:28 PM: Linda Zheng: Replace fat with muscles
8/25/16, 1:19:43 PM: Linda Zheng: Rock climbing does sound like a lot of fun!!
8/25/16, 1:20:10 PM: Linda Zheng: I'd wanted to do that when I first moved here but then forgot about it
8/25/16, 1:21:36 PM: Sean Reardon: you should get into it!  you're so tiny I bet you just fly up the wall
8/25/16, 1:22:22 PM: Linda Zheng: Would you like to watch?
8/25/16, 1:31:43 PM: Sean Reardon: *of course*
8/25/16, 2:17:54 PM: Linda Zheng: https://xkcd.com/radiation/
8/25/16, 2:21:25 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah, interesting huh!
8/25/16, 2:36:21 PM: Sean Reardon: makes you realize we're way too sensitive to the word "radiation"
8/25/16, 2:37:55 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha yeah, when you put it into perspective like the chart
8/25/16, 2:40:32 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah!
8/25/16, 2:41:26 PM: Sean Reardon: 1.  Fix first-past-the-post voting.
2.  Modulate voting with at-booth education tests.  ("Sun is bigger than earth.")
3.  Lose legal meaning of physical signatures.  No longer valid in law, older ones grandfathered.
4.  Vaccines mandatory.  Health decisions, in general, for children are left to state, not parents.
5.  For-profit health insurance is illegal.
6.  Cap-and-trade for carbon, other industrial sins (pollution, others?)
7.  Prostitution legalized.  Drug abuse = disease, not a crime.  Drugs decriminalization.
8.  Pharmaceuticals banned from marketing to general public.
9.  Universal Basic Income.
10.  Non-US state territories granted stateship.
8/25/16, 2:41:56 PM: Sean Reardon: did i share these with you?  a couple weeks back I woke up and wrote these down, titled it "america reboot" and then went back to sleep
8/25/16, 2:42:12 PM: Sean Reardon: not as cute as winning a trophy for being cute, but still kinda funny
8/25/16, 2:45:34 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh I like these!!
8/25/16, 2:46:02 PM: Linda Zheng: I agree with most of them, but not all
8/25/16, 2:46:39 PM: Linda Zheng: And I don't understand a couple :P
8/25/16, 2:46:54 PM: Sean Reardon: which dont' you agree with?
8/25/16, 2:58:07 PM: Linda Zheng: I agree with 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 (but I think health or any insurance is kinda silly but I can see why it's necessary). 

I don't really understand 6. 

7) I think prostitution is fine. Making it "illegal" doesn't stop people from loopholes so why not open it up. Like abortion lol. I don't think drug abuse should be coddled like that, especially if it's legalized. I also think there should be some regulations because people can't be trusted to control themselves lol (like with heroin, ecstasy, meth, lsd, shrooms)

8) I think as long as the side effects long and short term are mentioned and the general public is aware, and there are good fda regulations that actually stop harmful drugs from being distributed, it's fine if they market to general public. 

9) only if people still work and are productive

10) I don't understand public relations enough to see the implications of this
8/25/16, 3:14:59 PM: Sean Reardon: insurance is sort of an evil necessity.  having anyone profit from it is just insult to injury.
8/25/16, 3:17:43 PM: Sean Reardon: 6.  cap-and-trade is short hand for a system where you say "I want less X in the world.  Who makes X?  Let's go to each of those companies and find out just how much X each one of them makes.  Then we charge them a yearly tax on their quantities of X.  If they want, they can *trade* those tax burdens with other people."  What this does is creates a market for X.  if someone makes less X next year, they can *sell* those reduced quantities to another company.  and then you just raise the cost of the tax slowly until the industry has optimized itself away from making X.
8/25/16, 3:17:54 PM: Sean Reardon: the typical example is carbon trading.
8/25/16, 3:18:21 PM: Sean Reardon: polluting companies hurt the public, so the public taxes them by the amount they pollute.
8/25/16, 3:18:57 PM: Sean Reardon: and then those companies can trade their tax burden between themselves.
8/25/16, 3:21:10 PM: Sean Reardon: you're motivated to make less carbon because you're taxed on it (that's a typical 'sin tax', a tax designed to demotivate a particular behavior (like cigarette taxes)) but if you *do* make less carbon, you can sell those shares of carbon you would otherwise have been taxed on to your competitor and make a profit off of him.  he'll be motivated to buy them from you, because otherwise he has to pay even larger penalties for going over the limit that was placed on him.
8/25/16, 3:21:16 PM: Sean Reardon: works fairly well.
8/25/16, 3:23:01 PM: Sean Reardon: 7. i used to agree with you, but the countries that have tried radical decriminalization have found 1. the drug abuse problem *decreases* (because you're actually treating the problem) 2.  it's much cheaper  3.  it's much safer (black market operation becomes legal and drives out bad guys.)
8/25/16, 3:23:12 PM: Sean Reardon: so, the results suggest it's the right way to go.
8/25/16, 3:24:16 PM: Sean Reardon: 8. if only the general public could be trusted.  marketing is waay to effective on people.  we're actually the only country that allows pharma to advertise to the public.
8/25/16, 3:24:40 PM: Sean Reardon: 9.  why do you want people to work?
8/25/16, 3:24:55 PM: Linda Zheng: 6) wow that's really smart! I like it a lot!
8/25/16, 3:25:07 PM: Sean Reardon: 10.  I think I was kinda stretching to come up with a tenth.
8/25/16, 3:27:39 PM: Linda Zheng: 9) so that advancement can happen and things can be made! And services can happen
8/25/16, 3:28:52 PM: Sean Reardon: the people who do advancement and making things would still do so.
8/25/16, 3:29:40 PM: Sean Reardon: basically I think this century we should realize that work is for machines.
8/25/16, 3:30:11 PM: Sean Reardon: and that should free people up to make far more advancement than if they were just showing up and going through 40 hours a week of some dumb routine
8/25/16, 3:31:44 PM: Linda Zheng: Work is for machines. But what will the people who's jobs have been replaced but have no other skills? Will they just sit at home and do whatever and be rewarded for being useless?
8/25/16, 3:32:21 PM: Sean Reardon: we're all partly rewarded anyway, regardless of how useful we are.  UBI just suggests we go all the way.
8/25/16, 3:33:30 PM: Sean Reardon: right now the people whom would otherwise be sitting at home doing nothing are working at mcdonalds.  I think we'll come to feel that "needing to work in order to eat" is a form of slavery
8/25/16, 3:34:07 PM: Sean Reardon: but you hit on an interesting question, "what with they be doing, just sitting around?"
8/25/16, 3:35:29 PM: Sean Reardon: I fear the real answer is "idle hands are the devils tools"... those same guys whom would otherwise be working at mcdonalds will be getting bored and then causing mischief.  they aren't *all* going to discover they're shakespear.  most are going to get bored and be either dangerous or criminal.
8/25/16, 3:49:57 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah, it's not really "working just to eat". Which is kinda like slavery. It's more like working because otherwise there's nothing to do. I think ubi should guarantee meals and a place to live; basic survival needs. But working should still be encouraged in order to occupy time or make progress or to buy things
8/25/16, 4:00:03 PM: Sean Reardon: this is your least favorite song!  https://open.spotify.com/track/39UBKq6DH8JxKrvDkCu4SN
8/25/16, 4:00:08 PM: Sean Reardon: it's just pretty sounds
8/25/16, 4:00:33 PM: Sean Reardon: oh, yeah, that's exactly what UBI suggests.
8/25/16, 4:00:47 PM: Sean Reardon: kinda "how about everyone gets the bare minimum to live in a place and eat.
8/25/16, 4:00:53 PM: Linda Zheng: Spotify doesn't open :/

8/26/16, 12:57:43 PM: Sean Reardon: Sugar?  Or more complicated?
8/26/16, 1:00:48 PM: Linda Zheng: Just glazed
8/26/16, 1:08:21 PM: Sean Reardon: A simple glazed donut is so yummy.
8/26/16, 1:08:46 PM: Sean Reardon: Intense sugar high for me though and then a crash.  Redbull, stat!
8/26/16, 1:11:24 PM: Linda Zheng: It is! Oh I don't think I get sugar high and crashes. I didn't know you did! Red bull makes me crash though
8/26/16, 1:11:48 PM: Sean Reardon: Then I retract my redbull advice
8/26/16, 1:11:56 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha
8/26/16, 1:12:05 PM: Linda Zheng: Are you getting all your drugs?

8/26/16, 1:15:31 PM: Sean Reardon: Got the rx.  Thrive was out of wake up pill.  Now trying to get Walgreens to do it, but a fobe is in my way
8/26/16, 2:26:26 PM: Linda Zheng: Lolol they ran out of medicine at the pharmacy?? Sux.

8/27/16, 1:25:59 PM: Linda Zheng: How's la / carmie so far?
8/27/16, 1:39:05 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh my gosh Sean I don't know how to be social and have friends :(. You're literally the only person I enjoy interacting with. With everyone else (cap 1 friends), I always do have a good time with them when I do interact with them, but still, if I have a choice to not interact with them, I'll choose it. But at the same time, I'll feel bad about being left out. Like today, they're all going to the Perot and dinner and stuff.  And I should go since I literally have nothing else to do since you're not here. But I REALLY REALLY don't want to go (since I've been so many times). But I also feel left out and sad because I see all their messages in the fb group. I feel like I'd have fun if I did go. But the thought of leaving my house and going out and being social is just like dread to me. I don't know why. Maybe it's the laziness? Maybe it's the social anxiety? And now I'm on the volleyball team, but I really just wanna back out and tell them I can't do it. But I already backed out of softball. And they all talk about softball and how much fun it was and I felt sad about being left out. It was like this with my rice friends too. And I ended up with no friends after 4 years of college. This is happening all over again :(. I just don't know what to do or why I'm like this :(.
8/27/16, 1:45:04 PM: Linda Zheng: I think I just don't find socializing to be worthwhile. The alternative is just sitting at home by myself and watching tv and being high. Which is the epitome of *not* worthwhile. But at least that doesn't take any effort on my part since it's the "default". Maybe I should try thinking of hanging it with friends as the default (which is what I think you do). Then it won't feel like so much work and so much turmoil. Or maybe I should just be on weed, caffeine, alcohol, or adderrall all the time when socializing to enjoy it and not feel like work. But it shouldn't feel like work! Idk why it does to me :(
8/27/16, 2:45:22 PM: Sean Reardon: Maybe focus on work?  Trying to remember how it felt to me when I was your age.
8/27/16, 2:45:31 PM: Sean Reardon: Like, I'd probably be in the office today
8/27/16, 2:45:35 PM: Sean Reardon: Almost certainly
8/27/16, 2:56:28 PM: Linda Zheng: But you're so much smarter than me and you know how to do things by yourself and you built everything so you didn't need help from others. Like the next thing I need to do is onboard to osb and register the public endpoint. I have no idea how to do that at all. So I can't do anything without help. Which also made me kinda sad :(.
8/27/16, 2:59:37 PM: Linda Zheng: Sorry, I don't mean to be a downer, lol I'm not actually sad. Just thinking about sadness. Enjoy carmie and la!!!! :D
8/27/16, 3:00:59 PM: Linda Zheng: And I'm not bored lol. I just don't want to hang out with my friends but complaining about it lol.
8/27/16, 3:07:58 PM: Sean Reardon: Well, speaking to your point about being blocked at work, when I was blocked, I'd just do something else.  Even if it was just a personal research project.  It was like I was on wake up pill 24/7 back then :(
8/27/16, 3:08:41 PM: Linda Zheng: Awwwwwwww that must have been so wonderful!!!

9/1/16, 3:09:44 PM: Linda Zheng: Omg I was just about to tell you that I'm really cute today (I think), so I can hopefully represent husboo well! :)

9/6/16, 7:56:13 PM: Sean Reardon: See a movie or something?
9/6/16, 8:17:53 PM: Sean Reardon: Hm.  Maybe I could play some nms for a couple hours then come by late tonight?  Does that work just as well for you?
9/6/16, 8:19:02 PM: Linda Zheng: Sure!

9/6/16, 8:48:42 PM: Linda Zheng: Sup
9/6/16, 8:51:02 PM: Sean Reardon: Hm. I don't think you did!  We spoke!
9/6/16, 8:51:25 PM: Linda Zheng: Ohi just got another notification
9/6/16, 8:53:20 PM: Sean Reardon: Ha.  Oh whatsapp.
9/6/16, 9:48:36 PM: Linda Zheng: I still don't like flight of the concords. Not even when I was high
9/6/16, 9:49:20 PM: Sean Reardon: Omw!!

9/6/16, 10:06:06 PM: Sean Reardon: Pet?
9/6/16, 10:08:02 PM: Linda Zheng: Yes?
9/6/16, 10:08:29 PM: Sean Reardon: In resort now.  Be naked and in bed.  You have 1 minute, about
9/6/16, 10:08:48 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh no!
9/6/16, 10:10:31 PM: Sean Reardon: Lol glad these boxes are flat
9/7/16, 12:14:10 PM: Linda Zheng: I'm so sad :(
9/7/16, 12:18:38 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh no why babydoll?
9/7/16, 12:19:29 PM: Linda Zheng: I'm just not able to do anything at work and I've been stuck for like 2 weeks and I'm not sure what to do other than just sit and wait for help :(
9/7/16, 12:24:00 PM: Sean Reardon: ugh!
9/7/16, 12:24:05 PM: Sean Reardon: anything interesting with target?
9/7/16, 12:30:21 PM: Linda Zheng: Not yet. Finished the last thing and they're putting it into the actual test though! And meeting about target today. But nothing to actually do :( which stresses me out a lot... Should this be something to stress about? Or is this an expected part of starting a new job and first project?
9/7/16, 12:31:32 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe expected.  there are a ton of roadblocks.  people get good at taking long lunches if they're being responsible and letting their leads know when they're blocked
9/7/16, 12:33:55 PM: Linda Zheng: I've told them and they know and they're supposed to be helping me unblock some stuff, but they're just also really busy so everything takes a long time on their end
9/7/16, 12:34:20 PM: Sean Reardon: then you're a-okay :)
9/7/16, 12:34:26 PM: Sean Reardon: take a long lunch
9/7/16, 12:34:39 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe get some pokemon
9/7/16, 12:36:30 PM: Linda Zheng: But by this Friday we're supposed to have all these deployment things done, according to the plan, but it doesn't seem like it's going to happen so I'm worried that they'll think it's because I'm not working hard, which is why I'm so stressed about not making progress, even though I am really trying and just literally can't
9/7/16, 1:01:02 PM: Linda Zheng: <‎image omitted>
9/7/16, 3:11:02 PM: Sean Reardon: hahah lol
9/7/16, 3:11:12 PM: Sean Reardon: but "lag" is such a negative thing!
9/7/16, 3:11:35 PM: Linda Zheng: Lol true
9/7/16, 3:46:05 PM: Sean Reardon: Taxes done, no gayness for husboo!

9/8/16, 5:50:21 PM: Linda Zheng: Miss you too! Have to finish the "consumer" app. Which basically sits between the front end web application and back end api, accepts requests from front end and sends it to backend. Which is really simple and should take like 30 min to write, but idk how long it'll take to test and deploy locally to tomcat again lol
9/8/16, 5:51:00 PM: Linda Zheng: Because we want to test the entire system tomorrow morning so I have to finish this today
9/8/16, 5:52:13 PM: Linda Zheng: But I was writing documentation / being lazy / didn't have all the specifications to write it during the day lol

9/9/16, 12:31:40 PM: Sean Reardon: they burn out :(
9/9/16, 12:32:23 PM: Linda Zheng: Do you feel burnt out about work? Or do you feel motivation because you decide what you want to do or focus on?
9/9/16, 12:32:52 PM: Sean Reardon: when I get burned out I get bored, then I cause trouble until I define a new role to get excited about
9/9/16, 12:33:17 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh that's so cool!!!!
9/9/16, 12:33:41 PM: Linda Zheng: It's admirable that you constantly have some thing to be excited about
9/9/16, 1:26:51 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh no , fatty is leaving for 2 weeks for conference then training, then she's going back to her own team! I'm gonna miss having someone to complain with everyday

9/18/16, 6:44:26 PM: Linda Zheng: I wouldn't have minded/cared if you wanted to just hang out with people and drink but if you'd told me then I could have brought weed and prepared mentally because you know that being social for extended periods of time is difficult for me (even though you wouldn't consider this an "extended period of time")

9/22/16, 12:43:43 PM: Linda Zheng: "egg hatching speed - those seem to change between the updates but the 10,5km might be your best safe bet to record the most of your distance. The theory is that server gets pinged every minute while the visual update happens every 4 minute. This might be the most vague of all the theories so take it with a pinch of salt. Also I would appreciate if any fellow traveler would like to correct me or clarify the matter."

10/3/16, 3:27:41 PM: Linda Zheng: apparently, after the mid-20s, it's not worth it to keep doing exp grind, since it's harder to catch the grinding pokemon and takes SO much exp to level up
10/3/16, 3:34:33 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah, you should probably stop
10/3/16, 3:35:12 PM: Linda Zheng: um, that's not what i was saying
10/3/16, 3:35:34 PM: Sean Reardon: I mean you shouldn't do the exp grind anymore
10/3/16, 3:35:53 PM: Linda Zheng: will you keep doing it?
10/3/16, 3:36:11 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh of course not!  I hate inefficiency

10/3/16, 3:36:59 PM: Sean Reardon: Deal!
10/3/16, 3:37:22 PM: Sean Reardon: I should definitely be more gym focused
10/3/16, 3:37:46 PM: Linda Zheng: yeah! i need more stardust!
10/3/16, 3:37:50 PM: Linda Zheng: only have 1000 :(
10/3/16, 3:38:14 PM: Sean Reardon: Ugh frustrating.  Do you wish you could buy it?
10/3/16, 3:38:20 PM: Linda Zheng: yeah!
10/3/16, 3:38:40 PM: Linda Zheng: i wonder why they make stardust the only currency you can't buy
10/3/16, 3:38:59 PM: Sean Reardon: Well you can buy incense.  Basically the same
10/3/16, 3:39:16 PM: Linda Zheng: not really...... incense barely works :P
10/3/16, 3:39:33 PM: Linda Zheng: and you have to work even after buying incense
10/3/16, 3:42:53 PM: Sean Reardon: I love you making mouth sounds on a conference call

10/6/16, 5:28:04 PM: Sean Reardon: I think you ought to.  Might be good career wise.
10/6/16, 5:30:51 PM: Linda Zheng: Aw he's so nice! Could be fun, but I don't want to intrude because theyre probably all going to talk about data science stuff and I don't know anything lol
10/6/16, 5:31:53 PM: Sean Reardon: There's some rando trying to impersonate you on sms, using one of your numbers.
10/6/16, 5:32:13 PM: Linda Zheng: That's me! 2143994770
10/6/16, 5:32:21 PM: Linda Zheng: I'm committing
10/6/16, 5:32:26 PM: Linda Zheng: To iPhone
10/6/16, 5:32:32 PM: Sean Reardon: it feels super strange that it's on sms though, totally unexpected from you, and this person hasn't used my name yet or the name "linda" so I don't have any evidence that this is in fact you
10/6/16, 5:33:03 PM: Sean Reardon: then when I asked for confirmation from this rando, they made some comment about iphone, which continues to not provide any authentication that this is you.
10/6/16, 5:33:55 PM: Sean Reardon: the number you've just given me here is the same number they're texting me from, so I can conclude that this is authentic!
10/6/16, 5:33:57 PM: Sean Reardon: yay!
10/6/16, 5:34:13 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha yay! Such two factor authentication!
10/6/16, 5:34:50 PM: Sean Reardon: whew!  close call
10/6/16, 5:35:18 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha I just texted you from SMS so that your have the number
10/6/16, 5:36:29 PM: Linda Zheng: Was going to get real eating supplies, but the thought of having to clean them and knowing that they'll probably sit in my sink, Dirty, for weeks just caused me too much stress
10/6/16, 5:37:29 PM: Sean Reardon: ugh so awful!
10/6/16, 5:37:33 PM: Sean Reardon: you mean like plates?
10/6/16, 5:37:46 PM: Linda Zheng: Plates, bowls, spoons, cups
10/6/16, 5:37:57 PM: Linda Zheng: I also think bowls and cups serve almost the same purpose haha
10/6/16, 5:55:05 PM: Sean Reardon: they *almost* do!
10/6/16, 5:57:58 PM: Linda Zheng: And then bowls can be plates but plates cannot be bowls
10/6/16, 6:00:52 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe plates can have a lip to the edge of them and become both cups and bowls as well?
10/6/16, 6:02:25 PM: Linda Zheng: I would like to just have 1 container that is wide (like plate) with high walls (like bowl) and has a build in straw or sippy part (to function as cup)
10/6/16, 6:02:52 PM: Sean Reardon: I got all excited about the use of the word container just now :(
10/6/16, 6:03:20 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahaha I felt it!!
10/6/16, 6:10:33 PM: Sean Reardon: I kinda want to do pool side geeking.  Wanna join?

10/6/16, 6:12:54 PM: Linda Zheng: Yes perfect! I also have a couple work things to do!
10/6/16, 6:13:00 PM: Linda Zheng: Yes to aws!
10/6/16, 6:13:07 PM: Linda Zheng: After food?
10/6/16, 6:14:02 PM: Linda Zheng: But if you can, try to find a seat outside that has an outlet, because my laptop battery is not good
10/6/16, 6:15:06 PM: Sean Reardon: I think as a rule outlets and pools aren't traditionally near :(
10/6/16, 6:15:16 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe start charging it now
10/6/16, 6:15:31 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh that's okay I think it can last an hour
10/6/16, 6:15:38 PM: Linda Zheng: It's fully charged !

10/20/16, 5:11:56 PM: Linda Zheng: Nah

10/20/16, 5:12:37 PM: Sean Reardon: what is it you don't like about her?  once you pointed out the only-boys-all-the-time yeah it started being annoying to me too

10/20/16, 5:26:55 PM: Linda Zheng: I like hanging out with her when with other people as well because then she doesn't just talk to you about boys, and girl drama, that you give snarky, obvious solutions to :P
10/20/16, 5:27:24 PM: Sean Reardon: it's hard to hold back the snark often, ha
10/20/16, 5:28:50 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh no I took a break and now I've forgotten everything I was doing before

10/20/16, 5:38:10 PM: Sean Reardon: learning strategy
10/20/16, 5:38:18 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh really??? That's so smart and tedious!

10/20/16, 5:39:59 PM: Sean Reardon: you can run docker on ec2 yes
10/20/16, 5:40:06 PM: Sean Reardon: but ec2 doesn't imply docker
10/20/16, 5:49:15 PM: Linda Zheng: But there's this thing here:

10/20/16, 5:50:54 PM: Sean Reardon: aws compute is supplied through ec2.  containers run on ec2.
10/20/16, 5:50:57 PM: Linda Zheng: Ohhhhh JUST for the containers in docker
10/20/16, 5:51:28 PM: Sean Reardon: with their container service, they offer private registry service (that's really what that is and some sugar on top)
10/20/16, 5:51:34 PM: Sean Reardon: basically what I'm building myself now

I always lie on those "18 and up" websites that ask for a DOB. Not because I'm under 18, but because I'm so old, it's a hassle to scroll to find my actual year of birth.

10/27/16, 10:50:15 AM: Linda Zheng: What if I'm pregnant
10/27/16, 12:35:09 PM: Sean Reardon: If you go home, leave out that you threw up.  Tmi for workplace.  Ugh, don't tease me, please be pregnant!

10/27/16, 12:36:07 PM: Linda Zheng: I think it was because of the Sudafed, because after throwing up I feel much less anxious, even though im more sick lolol

10/27/16, 12:54:00 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah!!

10/27/16, 1:45:14 PM: Linda Zheng: I think I've diagnosised my problem. Sudafed interacts with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. I took antidepressant and Sudafed at the same time today. So Im less worried about pregnancy now :P. So you gotta try harder ;)

11/7/16, 10:15:41 PM: Sean Reardon: Global positioning system
11/7/16, 10:15:53 PM: Linda Zheng: Ohhh I see what you mean
11/7/16, 10:17:50 PM: Linda Zheng: Bluetooth gets quieter and quieter with each generation!
11/7/16, 10:18:31 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah kinda makes sense huh?  Older hardware is sloppier, the newer stuff is more precise
11/7/16, 10:18:46 PM: Sean Reardon: Interesting observation
11/7/16, 10:18:49 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah makes sense!
11/7/16, 10:19:21 PM: Linda Zheng: But GPS seems like a relatively old technology, but it's even lower than Bluetooth class 3
11/7/16, 10:19:29 PM: Sean Reardon: If you were a government and owned the spectrum, you'd protect all of it, but urge quieter and quieter too, I think
11/7/16, 10:19:51 PM: Sean Reardon: Very surprised how quiet gps is for how old it is
11/7/16, 10:20:03 PM: Sean Reardon: Guess it's because it's one way?

11/10/16, 3:18:51 PM: Sean Reardon: Wee!
11/10/16, 3:18:51 PM: Sean Reardon: But what are you wearing?
11/10/16, 3:20:00 PM: Sean Reardon: Standard nerd uniform!
11/10/16, 3:20:03 PM: Sean Reardon: No hat.
11/10/16, 3:20:22 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah I'll probably head direct to your place
11/10/16, 3:21:38 PM: Linda Zheng: im wearing jeans, pink tshirt, and black jacket. also kinda standard nerd uniform :/ but a lot cute
11/10/16, 3:21:41 PM: Linda Zheng: *cuter
11/10/16, 3:21:51 PM: Sean Reardon: Much cuter
11/10/16, 3:21:57 PM: Sean Reardon: Do you like jeans now?
11/10/16, 3:22:01 PM: Linda Zheng: also, no hat
11/10/16, 3:22:12 PM: Linda Zheng: i don't wear *real* jeans
11/10/16, 3:22:15 PM: Linda Zheng: just jeggings
11/10/16, 3:22:20 PM: Sean Reardon: Right right
11/10/16, 3:22:30 PM: Linda Zheng: i like them!
11/10/16, 3:22:42 PM: Sean Reardon: But do you like them more than tights or outside panties?
11/10/16, 3:22:43 PM: Linda Zheng: but i'd much rather wear no pants
11/10/16, 3:22:48 PM: Linda Zheng: no
11/10/16, 3:22:52 PM: Linda Zheng: not at all
11/10/16, 3:23:25 PM: Linda Zheng: wearing clothes is the second worst part of having a job
11/10/16, 3:24:21 PM: Sean Reardon: I wish you were at least a part time stripper
11/10/16, 3:24:29 PM: Sean Reardon: You'd be good at it and enjoy it
11/10/16, 3:25:50 PM: Linda Zheng: i don't know......... as i've become lazier and lazier these last few months, being a stripper seems less and less appealing
11/10/16, 3:26:21 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh it's too much effort?  Interesting.
11/10/16, 3:26:41 PM: Sean Reardon: I figure it's less effort than thinking and working with teams of people
11/10/16, 3:28:51 PM: Linda Zheng: but "thinking and working with teams of people" just involves sitting and typing
11/10/16, 3:29:08 PM: Linda Zheng: being a stripper takes so much movement!
11/10/16, 3:30:29 PM: Sean Reardon: Tru tru
11/10/16, 3:39:54 PM: Sean Reardon: What's the name of the hacker test site you were using the other day?

11/10/16, 5:32:35 PM: Linda Zheng: Did you want me to say no so that youd have a reason to not go?
11/10/16, 5:34:24 PM: Sean Reardon: Lemme think on that.  Probably not, but thank you for the option
11/10/16, 5:41:31 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh ha I sent my question about reservation to you not kristy

11/14/16, 5:50:57 PM: Sean Reardon: as like a header of sorts, independent of implementation
11/14/16, 5:54:47 PM: Linda Zheng: Not sure...

11/15/16, 2:52:12 PM: Linda Zheng: i think i accidentally threw away the other lid
11/15/16, 2:52:34 PM: Linda Zheng: we should just take pics of all the lids and upload them in to the spreadsheet or something lol
11/15/16, 2:53:03 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah was just looking for how to attach a pic to the sheet.  Wasn't obvious

11/15/16, 4:04:56 PM: Linda Zheng: LOL
11/15/16, 4:04:57 PM: Linda Zheng: no
11/15/16, 4:05:44 PM: Linda Zheng: the api goes live tonight, so at 9:30 they set up a call to do validation and stuff to make sure it's all working
11/15/16, 4:06:00 PM: Linda Zheng: im not sure why they do it at night
11/15/16, 4:06:27 PM: Linda Zheng: omg google is coming to dallas to interview, and they chose me as someone they might want to interview!
11/15/16, 4:06:30 PM: Linda Zheng: should i do it??
11/15/16, 4:06:50 PM: Linda Zheng: i already have a job....
11/15/16, 4:07:21 PM: Sean Reardon: you should definitely interview if for no other reason than fun!
11/15/16, 4:07:30 PM: Sean Reardon: great experience for you!
11/15/16, 4:07:32 PM: Linda Zheng: but it's not fun
11/15/16, 4:07:34 PM: Sean Reardon: I would do it
11/15/16, 4:07:36 PM: Linda Zheng: it's so stressful
11/15/16, 4:07:46 PM: Linda Zheng: but i guess it shouldn't be stressful anymore since i have a job
11/15/16, 4:07:48 PM: Sean Reardon: delete "fun" and replace "wise" then
11/15/16, 4:07:52 PM: Linda Zheng: so it would just be for experience
11/15/16, 4:07:52 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah definitely
11/15/16, 4:07:58 PM: Sean Reardon: yes!
11/15/16, 4:08:40 PM: Linda Zheng: but it's during work....
11/15/16, 4:08:49 PM: Linda Zheng: it feels weird to take time off work to interview
11/15/16, 4:08:59 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe it goes live at night because that it's a nice midpoint between fewer customers plus developers are awake?
11/15/16, 4:09:05 PM: Sean Reardon: ha, yeah
11/15/16, 5:20:17 PM: Linda Zheng: my jelly beans arrived! 😁

11/15/16, 8:08:25 PM: Linda Zheng: lol yeah.......
11/15/16, 8:09:09 PM: Linda Zheng: omg im so worried!
11/15/16, 8:09:11 PM: Sean Reardon: Mathew mentioned to your mom that I'd asked them to come down for thanksgiving, and he brought it up with her.  her response was that she wanted to hear it from you.
11/15/16, 8:09:24 PM: Linda Zheng: noooooooooooo
11/15/16, 8:09:30 PM: Sean Reardon: which is why I wondered if you had an apt to talk to your mom tonight, hahaa
11/15/16, 8:09:33 PM: Linda Zheng: that's why she's being so weird
11/15/16, 8:09:43 PM: Linda Zheng: im not going to ask
11/15/16, 8:09:50 PM: Sean Reardon: whoops, guess we're just in love then
11/15/16, 8:09:53 PM: Sean Reardon: aww yeah?
11/15/16, 8:10:08 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah with you dad out of town it's kinda strange maybe
11/15/16, 8:10:11 PM: Linda Zheng: ugh i keep forgetting that i have parents
11/15/16, 8:10:26 PM: Sean Reardon: you have one mom and two dads :(
11/15/16, 8:10:44 PM: Linda Zheng: i get secretly annoyed when my mom texts me or calls me or asks how im doing
11/15/16, 8:10:54 PM: Linda Zheng: and she won't mail me my 3ds until i ask
11/15/16, 8:10:59 PM: Linda Zheng: which im so not going to
11/15/16, 8:11:08 PM: Linda Zheng: like now she's made it into a game
11/15/16, 8:11:23 PM: Sean Reardon: ha families are hilarious that way
11/15/16, 8:11:28 PM: Sean Reardon: power struggles
11/15/16, 8:11:45 PM: Linda Zheng: im kinda annoyed at you as well tbh
11/15/16, 8:12:09 PM: Sean Reardon: that's fair!  I shouldn't have asked him without going to you first
11/15/16, 8:12:33 PM: Sean Reardon: you're so brave lately!
11/15/16, 8:13:40 PM: Linda Zheng: im also sending mixed signals, i think
11/15/16, 8:14:41 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe I'm just annoying when I'm around this often?
11/15/16, 8:18:52 PM: Linda Zheng: i mean, im sending mixed signals, as in, i can't decide whether or not to tell my parents about you. probably because i can't or haven't really decided how serious i feel about us or whether or not we're actually a good fit or whether or not we're actually going to work out? 


and im also worried that as we become closer and closer, my true self is going to come out, and you're going to realize that im actually a really mean little girl. because if i feel close and familiar with someone, i get less patient and more easily grumpy.
11/15/16, 9:11:41 PM: Sean Reardon: sorry, had to stop typing because randy came over to talk to me
11/15/16, 9:11:51 PM: Sean Reardon: not intentionally ignoring you
11/15/16, 9:11:56 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh no worries!
11/15/16, 9:12:29 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm zero worried about your true self coming out.
11/15/16, 9:12:57 PM: Sean Reardon: you keep mentioning that as though it's some alternate version of you
11/15/16, 9:13:30 PM: Sean Reardon: you keep not understanding that that alternate person is actually whom I'm in love with, and I keep having to see through your mask to see that person
11/15/16, 9:13:42 PM: Linda Zheng: Awww
11/15/16, 9:13:50 PM: Linda Zheng: Thats so sweet Sean
11/15/16, 9:13:54 PM: Sean Reardon: as far as mixed signals, yeah, you need to figure your shit out :)
11/15/16, 9:14:11 PM: Sean Reardon: I adore you and I'm in.  I'm bought in on the Linda train.
11/15/16, 9:14:12 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah....
11/15/16, 9:14:53 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe you need to have an awful relationship and have it melt down in front of your family before you understand that it's okay to risk a relationship?
11/15/16, 9:15:41 PM: Sean Reardon: it's okay to be scared.  I'm scared too!  but if you hold me at arms length then we'll never get any further.
11/15/16, 9:15:50 PM: Sean Reardon: and maybe we're okay where we are now?
11/15/16, 9:15:55 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe me too?
11/15/16, 9:16:17 PM: Sean Reardon: sorry, didn't mean to bring your attention over to relationship stuff just before your call
11/15/16, 9:24:03 PM: Linda Zheng: Thats true, I like where we are now though, and I also like the idea of being with you in the future as well. Like it's very comforting and warm and happy
11/15/16, 9:25:15 PM: Sean Reardon: we can stay in neutral.  I'm okay with that for now.  but when you tell me you want me to come to your home for xmas I'll start making plans!  so careful :)
11/15/16, 9:25:46 PM: Sean Reardon: good luck on your phone call!
11/15/16, 9:26:53 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha got it! I'll try to not give you more false hope!
11/15/16, 9:26:57 PM: Linda Zheng: Thanks!
11/15/16, 9:29:47 PM: Linda Zheng: can you hep me open jelly beans?
11/15/16, 9:30:32 PM: Sean Reardon: yep.  they'll be open af
11/15/16, 9:32:48 PM: Linda Zheng: its really closed
11/15/16, 9:59:47 PM: Linda Zheng: done with phone call!
11/15/16, 10:00:42 PM: Sean Reardon: how'd it go??
11/15/16, 10:02:20 PM: Linda Zheng: good! it worked on the east region, but did not work in the west region because the database's security group doesn't allow traffic from the west region. so i had to email the guys who do the security group stuff to open up the security group to allow traffic from the west. so after they do that, we'll validate it again lol. which is fine, because the team that was supposed to intergrate it this week is behind scheulde so they won't be able to until december 7th. so all in all, the call was 4/5!
11/15/16, 10:03:24 PM: Sean Reardon: where is the database located?
11/15/16, 10:03:29 PM: Sean Reardon: do you have any sense of that?
11/15/16, 10:04:16 PM: Linda Zheng: It is in the West region I mean sorry the East region of AWS LOL so wherever that is
11/15/16, 10:04:44 PM: Sean Reardon: your app is in aws east and the database is in west?
11/15/16, 10:05:00 PM: Sean Reardon: east is their biggest, most thing end up in aws east
11/15/16, 10:05:37 PM: Linda Zheng: The app has gotten deployed into EC two instances on the east region and the West region as well. The API calls the database that only allows traffic from the east region and it is in the East region but we can open it up to allow traffic from the West region as well.
11/15/16, 10:05:54 PM: Sean Reardon: ah, I see
11/15/16, 10:05:57 PM: Sean Reardon: that makes sense
11/15/16, 10:06:13 PM: Sean Reardon: I keep forgetting the relationship between zones and regions
11/15/16, 10:06:23 PM: Sean Reardon: I think regions are the parent and zones are under regions
11/15/16, 10:06:34 PM: Sean Reardon: ie, "east has 3 zones" etc
11/15/16, 10:07:01 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah, it kind of makes sense as well. But it just has too many labels
11/15/16, 10:07:26 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah like regions regions are the parents and zones are the children in the family
11/15/16, 10:07:33 PM: Sean Reardon: yep

11/17/16, 10:51:25 AM: Linda Zheng: omg i have such a happy story about work!  on the team that i am on, there are 5 people working on 3 different projects and  we are very disjointed in that no one else on the team knows about the other projects other than the one we are working on. so  my manager wants us to get to know each other's projects better. I'm working on my own project and my manager wants me to pick up one of the other projects on the team that is pretty similar in technology as my project so he wants us two to get to know each other's projects. but the 3rd project on the team is image recognition and using machine learning and tensor flow and things like that, like all my favorite things!!! so instead of being passive and not caring, i decided to take a chance and be assertive and speak out! which you know i never do, because I'm shy and find it hard to care about things very much. but i let him know that i wanted to work on the machine learning project as well and i don't mind if it will be more work because i really like it! and he was like "oh great!! that is such great input and feedback from you!". and it made me so happy because like the one time i took a chance and was assertive, it worked out!! so maybe i will be more like this in the future. but it's so hard to care / be motivated enough to not be passive
11/17/16, 12:18:03 PM: Linda Zheng: Boyfriend, max's performance thing is today?

11/30/16, 1:39:47 PM: Linda Zheng: Aw, I had a dream that I cheated on you :(
11/30/16, 1:44:16 PM: Sean Reardon: aww :(
11/30/16, 1:44:20 PM: Sean Reardon: don't beat yourself up.
11/30/16, 1:44:24 PM: Sean Reardon: dreams are random
11/30/16, 1:44:38 PM: Sean Reardon: it's kinda heartbreaking when that happens huh
11/30/16, 1:44:42 PM: Linda Zheng: Aw thanks
11/30/16, 1:44:45 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah!!
11/30/16, 1:44:52 PM: Sean Reardon: I forgive you :)
11/30/16, 1:45:17 PM: Sean Reardon: I tease you about cheating all the time, and I can only do that because I trust you.
11/30/16, 1:45:22 PM: Linda Zheng: Yay! :)
11/30/16, 1:45:32 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha true true
11/30/16, 1:57:27 PM: Linda Zheng: Playing hooky is a lot of fun! ^_^
11/30/16, 1:57:48 PM: Sean Reardon: right??
11/30/16, 1:57:56 PM: Sean Reardon: are you taking the rest of the day off?
11/30/16, 1:59:07 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah, I was about to go but then I saw that there's a party at 3. And people usually all leave right after the party anyway so there's no point in going anymore
11/30/16, 2:02:41 PM: Sean Reardon: why not go to the party?  you need friends babydoll!
11/30/16, 2:02:57 PM: Sean Reardon: you should go and bring everyone weed.  actually don't do that last part.
11/30/16, 2:03:16 PM: Linda Zheng: Lol I got anxious at the thought of socializing ! 
11/30/16, 2:04:17 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahahaha no!
11/30/16, 2:04:43 PM: Linda Zheng: You think I need friends ?
11/30/16, 2:05:18 PM: Linda Zheng: I keep feeling like when I feel the need for friends , I can get them, but for now, I am okay
11/30/16, 2:05:37 PM: Linda Zheng: But I don't think that's how friendships or relationships work
11/30/16, 2:08:08 PM: Sean Reardon: you think you need friends, and I agree
11/30/16, 2:08:14 PM: Sean Reardon: you've said so many times
11/30/16, 2:08:24 PM: Sean Reardon: socializing yields friends.
11/30/16, 2:08:31 PM: Sean Reardon: not socializing yields no friends
11/30/16, 2:10:12 PM: Linda Zheng: Sometimes I feel like having someone to talk to or hang out with and do fun activities with them would be fun. But it's so much work to have friends and the thought of socializing stresses me out and makes me anxious. And I have you and you pretty much fulfill that role. So the benefits  of socializing don't quite outweigh the effort. Other than things like board game night (sometimes )
11/30/16, 2:13:44 PM: Sean Reardon: I hear ya :)
11/30/16, 2:13:54 PM: Sean Reardon: It's your special day, I'm glad you're kicking back

12/5/16, 6:05:35 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm making decent progress still!  have a python script that can create a softlayer vm, and another that can tear it down.
12/5/16, 6:05:56 PM: Sean Reardon: so, between those, and my ansible scripts, I can stand up and provision an infrastructure
12/5/16, 6:06:14 PM: Sean Reardon: lots of automation left to go, but think I've proven out most of the bits
12/5/16, 6:06:33 PM: Linda Zheng: Wow that's awesome!!
12/5/16, 6:07:09 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah, the softlayer stuff ended up being fairly easy
12/5/16, 6:07:43 PM: Linda Zheng: The terraform stuff? Did you decide to go with terraform in the end or use another language?
12/5/16, 6:08:01 PM: Sean Reardon: nope, terraform wasn't well enough supported outside of aws
12/5/16, 6:08:05 PM: Sean Reardon: so put that aside
12/5/16, 6:08:33 PM: Linda Zheng: Icy. What are you going to work on next?
12/5/16, 6:08:54 PM: Sean Reardon: the future feels like it's [terraform + docker] but until terraform is better established we're [cloud api + ansible+docker]
12/5/16, 6:09:14 PM: Sean Reardon: ansible isn't awful
12/5/16, 6:11:05 PM: Sean Reardon: ansible is actually pretty better than chef or puppet it seems

12/5/16, 6:15:18 PM: Linda Zheng: 30 is starting to sound younger and younger
12/5/16, 6:15:38 PM: Linda Zheng: it used to sound IMPOSSIBLY old
12/5/16, 6:17:33 PM: Sean Reardon: let me tell you how 40 sounds......
12/5/16, 6:17:34 PM: Sean Reardon: ....
12/5/16, 6:17:36 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah
12/5/16, 6:18:22 PM: Linda Zheng: 30+ were pretty much all the same, until 60, where it morphs into an "elderly" feeling
12/5/16, 6:22:37 PM: Sean Reardon: 40 is scary to me.
12/5/16, 6:22:40 PM: Sean Reardon: 50 is scary.

12/6/16, 12:14:11 PM: Linda Zheng: but i can't because the TDP's are playing white elephant today at 4, so i have to stay until at least then
12/6/16, 12:14:27 PM: Linda Zheng: it's my quarterly social time with friends
12/6/16, 12:14:31 PM: Sean Reardon: Lol sucks.

12/6/16, 12:14:57 PM: Linda Zheng: and im really stressed, because i really want to end up with the best gift~!
12/6/16, 12:15:25 PM: Linda Zheng: which would make up for these extra hours i stayed to take part in the event
12/6/16, 12:15:49 PM: Linda Zheng: otherwise, i'll be unreasonably sad and feel like it's not fair again
12/6/16, 12:16:07 PM: Sean Reardon: Stamp foot, etc
12/6/16, 12:16:16 PM: Linda Zheng: hmm!!
12/6/16, 12:16:24 PM: Linda Zheng: hmph!
12/6/16, 12:17:22 PM: Linda Zheng: no, the gym has changed a lot recently lol
12/6/16, 12:17:34 PM: Sean Reardon: Gaw
12/6/16, 12:18:05 PM: Linda Zheng: but your team's gyms will be easier to power-up again. they reverted back to the original amount of prestige

12/6/16, 1:41:36 PM: Sean Reardon: That's genius!  We should definitely participate, if only to study!
12/6/16, 1:41:54 PM: Linda Zheng: Observe!
12/6/16, 1:42:01 PM: Sean Reardon: Yessss
12/6/16, 2:48:47 PM: Sean Reardon: Putting appointments on your calendar just for your awareness.  Maybe you want to join the Macfees one though?
12/6/16, 2:49:06 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh yay thanks!
12/6/16, 2:49:29 PM: Sean Reardon: Are you excited for white elephant??
12/6/16, 2:49:41 PM: Linda Zheng: Yes!
12/6/16, 2:50:02 PM: Linda Zheng: But can't be too exited because might not get the best one!
12/6/16, 2:51:23 PM: Sean Reardon: Do you know what the options are yet?
12/6/16, 2:51:32 PM: Linda Zheng: Nope!
12/6/16, 2:53:27 PM: Sean Reardon: Well, here's some strategy for you:  in situations like this, the buyer generally tries to have the same cost for every gift, with a few outliers.  So, sometimes it's smart to go for the smallest items.  It maximizes value density.
12/6/16, 2:53:34 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm praying for you!
12/6/16, 2:55:04 PM: Linda Zheng: But no one bought any of the gifts, the Fun Committee bought gifts for everyone. It feels unfair because obviously the last person has the greatest advantage.
12/6/16, 2:55:33 PM: Linda Zheng: Thanks for your prayers!
12/6/16, 2:56:14 PM: Sean Reardon: This is very true.  You want to draw the highest number.  I used to bat my eyes and say "but it's my birthday!" When I drew too low of a number, so I could redraw
12/6/16, 2:56:22 PM: Sean Reardon: You have some pretty eyes.
12/6/16, 2:56:54 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahahahaha omg nice!!!!

Unlike humans, mantis shrimp have hexnocular vision because they have six pupils in their eyes. This allows them to see prey much more accurately than humans can. Mantis shrimp also have twelve colour receptors in their eyes, unlike humans' three.

1/4/17, 10:04:03 PM: Linda Zheng: yeah, your brain is expecting an "s", which would trigger the "fat" feeling associated with "lbs"
1/4/17, 10:04:16 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah!!

1/7/17, 2:31:33 PM: Sean Reardon: At village health partners, the place you've been with me, they've prescribed me depression meds.

1/7/17, 2:36:25 PM: Linda Zheng: Can a regular doctor dp that? I thought only psychiatrists could
1/7/17, 2:38:34 PM: Linda Zheng: Like I want to tell them "I am on lexapro, but it makes me unmotivated. I want buproprion instead." And I want them to be like "hmm okay what are your symptoms of depression?" And I'll tell them. And I want them to be like "okay, with the power vested in me by my medical/psychiatric license, I deem buproprion to be beneficial and not harmful to your well-being." Something like that

1/8/17, 8:25:54 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah! That's how he started talking about this lol
1/8/17, 8:41:48 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh no Sean, when I came into the hotel, this man took my bags fore and led me to check in and waited for me to check in and explained the hotel and bus services to me and walked me to my room with my bags. But I did not expect to be helped or serviced so I did not have any cash. So I did not tip him. Is that okay? Should I have tipped him? I did not seek out his help. And I would have tipped him, I just did not have any cash! I hope he's not mad at me because I want him to help me in the future !
1/8/17, 8:44:17 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah you gots ta be careful to not accidentally accept help from bellhops

1/8/17, 9:18:12 PM: Linda Zheng: Blt
1/8/17, 9:18:40 PM: Sean Reardon: You're only alive for so long.  Consume as much of the world as you can.
1/8/17, 9:19:53 PM: Linda Zheng: That's true
1/8/17, 9:20:21 PM: Linda Zheng: It'll just pass and be a forgotten memory anyway
1/8/17, 9:22:10 PM: Sean Reardon: True.  At the end of time we'll all just be atoms of iron floating around the universe anyway
1/8/17, 9:24:56 PM: Linda Zheng: Sean, it's hard to motivate myself to do things at all
1/8/17, 9:25:09 PM: Linda Zheng: Much less things that bring anxiety and hate
1/8/17, 9:25:16 PM: Sean Reardon: Maybe you should see a psychiatrist or a counselor?
1/8/17, 9:25:33 PM: Linda Zheng: Even if it would make you proud of me :P
1/8/17, 9:26:11 PM: Sean Reardon: If you actually went to barmini I'd have been worried for you :)  obviously you wouldn't go

1/9/17, 4:40:24 PM: Sean Reardon: It would be fun to have really rapey sex in front of him so he's confused if he should help or if this is normal
1/9/17, 4:41:42 PM: Linda Zheng: i think he'd only be confused about whether or not to help in the beginning. after a few times of rapey sex, he'd know that this is how his mom like it
1/9/17, 4:41:45 PM: Linda Zheng: *likes
1/9/17, 4:41:53 PM: Sean Reardon: Right right

1/11/17, 2:36:16 PM: Linda Zheng: But I don't want to do this task :( . It's literally just using a UI with some simple JavaScript. I thought this was just going to be like a low-maintainance, side responsibility. I just want to do programming and this is no programming at all. 

Like what should I do? Should I tell my acting manager? He didn't really want me to do this either because he also wants me to do actual programming. But I don't officially report to him anymore :(. This is what my first manager wanted me to do, but I also don't report to her.
1/11/17, 2:37:03 PM: Linda Zheng: I also don't want to be here for 2 more weeks because it's so cold here and I miss you and couch and bed :(

1/12/17, 1:10:42 PM: Linda Zheng: yes! 1/20 is friday
1/12/17, 1:10:52 PM: Sean Reardon: Excellent
1/12/17, 1:11:03 PM: Sean Reardon: I'll get tickets.  Where is hotel?
1/12/17, 1:11:14 PM: Linda Zheng: wait, just get ticket for yourself
1/12/17, 1:11:21 PM: Sean Reardon: Yep
1/12/17, 1:11:23 PM: Linda Zheng: because i need to book through c1's travel thingy
1/12/17, 1:11:29 PM: Sean Reardon: Yep
1/12/17, 1:12:11 PM: Sean Reardon: I mean you'll already be there from earlier in the week and then later after I leave.  Correct?
1/12/17, 1:14:12 PM: Linda Zheng: i will fly to DC the night of 1/16 (tuesday). the plan is for me to just do 1 extra week. so if you do not come, i will fly to DFW on 1/20.
1/12/17, 1:14:25 PM: Linda Zheng: if you do come, i will fly to DFW on 1/22
1/12/17, 1:14:32 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh, rgr that
1/12/17, 1:14:59 PM: Sean Reardon: And still coming home this weekend for cuddles?
1/12/17, 1:16:47 PM: Linda Zheng: i want to stay at the hyatt by the mall by C1 during the week. but this location is like 30 min from ACTUAL DC where all the fun things you want to go are. but idk if they will let me book the hotel through the weekend since the weekend would be personal
1/12/17, 1:17:20 PM: Sean Reardon: Just do the Hyatt til friday
1/12/17, 1:17:24 PM: Linda Zheng: but i could book it through the weekend and then not expense the weekend hotel to C1
1/12/17, 1:17:34 PM: Sean Reardon: Then stay at chey reardon
1/12/17, 1:17:45 PM: Linda Zheng: chey reardon
1/12/17, 1:17:46 PM: Linda Zheng: LOLOL
1/12/17, 1:17:50 PM: Sean Reardon: Which would be at a closer place
1/12/17, 1:18:02 PM: Linda Zheng: oh is that an actual place?
1/12/17, 1:18:29 PM: Sean Reardon: So long as their site allows for hotel to stop earlier than flight return day.
1/12/17, 1:18:36 PM: Sean Reardon: Nope :)
1/12/17, 1:19:05 PM: Linda Zheng: yeah, idk the portal is very slow and confusing for me to use
1/12/17, 1:19:08 PM: Linda Zheng: let me try
1/12/17, 1:19:27 PM: Sean Reardon: I'll get a flight that arrives as early Friday as I can and a hotel in fun spot.  You just come to me.
1/12/17, 1:19:44 PM: Linda Zheng: wait, but let's try to book the same flight together on the way home!
1/12/17, 1:19:54 PM: Linda Zheng: and do DCA
1/12/17, 1:19:58 PM: Linda Zheng: not the other airport
1/12/17, 1:20:21 PM: Sean Reardon: Okay.  Do as late as you can on Sunday that's a nonstop and on American
1/12/17, 1:20:37 PM: Sean Reardon: Then lemme know what that is and I'll match
1/12/17, 1:20:39 PM: Linda Zheng: lol yeah, that was the plan
1/12/17, 1:22:53 PM: Linda Zheng: wait... it might be difficult for you to fly in on friday because that's when the inauguration speech is, so that might impact travel
1/12/17, 1:23:07 PM: Linda Zheng: and it might be difficult to get a hotel in the city for the same reason
1/12/17, 1:23:09 PM: Linda Zheng: do you think so?
1/12/17, 1:23:35 PM: Sean Reardon: Yep.  But not your worry

1/12/17, 1:31:17 PM: Linda Zheng: oh! i could do 25E and then you could do 25D, if you qualify for frequent traveler!
1/12/17, 1:31:44 PM: Sean Reardon: We can move seats around after tickets are purchased

1/13/17, 5:42:16 PM: Sean Reardon: on plane atm?
1/13/17, 5:42:22 PM: Linda Zheng: First it was just 10 min
1/13/17, 5:42:41 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah!!! Like they just boarded everyone and then was like "oops plane is broken"
1/13/17, 5:42:57 PM: Linda Zheng: Like rlwhy didn't they check plane before boarding???
1/13/17, 5:43:27 PM: Sean Reardon: they do things all in parallel to save time, but when one of those threads stalls it screws up everything
1/13/17, 5:43:48 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh makes sense
1/13/17, 5:44:38 PM: Linda Zheng: Well they could check plane while passengers are unloading , so that before the next batch of people board they know if plane is okay
1/13/17, 5:45:04 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm sure they do!

1/13/17, 6:37:31 PM: Linda Zheng: Like now, the people with connections won't make their flights so now AA has to rebook them and put them in hotels for the night in Dallas. But a lot of people didn't want to stay overnight in Dallas and wanted to get off. But then the attendant was like "well... Just so you know, there's going to be ice and snow tomorrow so well probably have to rebook you anyway..."
1/13/17, 6:38:13 PM: Linda Zheng: And now everyone is standing up and clamoring about what to do haha

1/16/17, 4:41:27 PM: Sean Reardon: lol
1/16/17, 5:03:56 PM: Linda Zheng: Instead of pressurizing the cabin, can they just put some plants in the cabin? So the plants would take all the co2 that humans breathe and convert into o2?
1/16/17, 5:04:21 PM: Sean Reardon: pressure is different than mixture of o2
1/16/17, 5:04:32 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh
1/16/17, 5:04:39 PM: Sean Reardon: you don't want your eyes popping out :)
1/16/17, 5:04:46 PM: Sean Reardon: know that feeling you get on your ears?
1/16/17, 5:05:06 PM: Linda Zheng: So the problem isn't that there isn't enough oxygen, it's the pressure of the atmosphere?
1/16/17, 5:05:07 PM: Sean Reardon: thats the plane desperately trying to keep reasonable pressure
1/16/17, 5:05:11 PM: Sean Reardon: correct
1/16/17, 5:05:17 PM: Linda Zheng: Ah I see
1/16/17, 5:05:29 PM: Sean Reardon: if there's low enough pressure, then yeah, there's also a lack of oxygen
1/16/17, 5:05:40 PM: Sean Reardon: so if that were to happen, you get oxygen masks
1/16/17, 5:05:53 PM: Sean Reardon: so I guess the reduced pressure isn't fatal?
1/16/17, 5:06:04 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe you're right?   that its a lack of o2?  hmm
1/16/17, 5:06:12 PM: Sean Reardon: sure isn't comfortable though
1/16/17, 5:07:28 PM: Linda Zheng: When the plane is taking off, and you feel that feeling in your ears, it's because the atmospheric pressure is lowering as you're gaining altitude ?
1/16/17, 5:07:49 PM: Sean Reardon: that's my understanding.
1/16/17, 5:08:06 PM: Sean Reardon: and that it would continue to drop except for the plane getting "pressurized"
1/16/17, 5:08:12 PM: Linda Zheng: I see
1/16/17, 5:08:46 PM: Linda Zheng: How does pressurizing the cabin before taking off help? Do they just put the extra pressure in storage somewhere and then pump it into the cabin as needed?
1/16/17, 5:08:53 PM: Sean Reardon: which, like I said, I think isn't airtight (can't be) so there's probably a set of compressors and barometers that detect amount of pressure and direct the compressors to work harder or less hard
1/16/17, 5:09:05 PM: Sean Reardon: before take off the pressure is fine
1/16/17, 5:09:06 PM: Sean Reardon: 1:1
1/16/17, 5:11:49 PM: Sean Reardon: appears to be 14 lbs at sea level and 4 lbs per square feet at 30k
1/16/17, 5:12:18 PM: Sean Reardon: guessing there's a fairly decent range for most out of shape americans that planes try to stay between
1/16/17, 5:13:14 PM: Sean Reardon: like at sea level it's 14, and people can be comfortable down to 8, so the plane desperately tries to achieve at least 12 and alarms the pilot to land if  it crosses 10 (or something)

1/16/17, 5:50:20 PM: Linda Zheng: Lol look at this try hard


I (millennial) will be marching in DC on Saturday. I think for many of us, we have been under the Obama bubble for our formative years and now we are realizing that is gone. I fall under the category of women who "probably don't have to worry about Trump." I am a white, upper-middle class, childless woman who has: 1. the financial means to get to DC 2. the ability to take PTO 3. the flexibility to take PTO whenever I want 4. the ability to travel without anyone depending on me 5. enough of a network to be able to have a place to stay in DC 6. a family who will be marching alongside me I like to think I am marching for all the Americans who want to but can't, because they are working a second shift, taking care of their family, can't afford the travel, scared of being outed for who they are, afraid of being deported, etc.

1/16/17, 6:03:47 PM: Linda Zheng: What are the port statuses supposed to be?
1/16/17, 6:05:16 PM: Sean Reardon: as best as I can tell I expect each and every port to be "filtered"
1/16/17, 6:05:29 PM: Sean Reardon: open = "if you want to talk, and there's someone listening, then you can"
1/16/17, 6:05:45 PM: Sean Reardon: closed = "I met you at the door and told you no, you're not allowed in"
1/16/17, 6:06:05 PM: Sean Reardon: filtered = "i hid inside my house while you knocked so you didn't know if anyone was home even"
1/16/17, 6:06:11 PM: Sean Reardon: that's my understanding
1/16/17, 6:06:13 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahaha
1/16/17, 6:06:30 PM: Linda Zheng: So they should all be filtered, but are currently too open ?
1/16/17, 6:06:38 PM: Sean Reardon: correct
1/16/17, 6:18:39 PM: Sean Reardon: I've had better luck turning off that interface entirely
1/16/17, 6:19:54 PM: Linda Zheng: Do you configure each port individually?
1/16/17, 6:20:10 PM: Sean Reardon: wait, maybe I found a bug... testing now
1/16/17, 6:20:25 PM: Sean Reardon: no, you (as I understand it) configure each network interface
1/16/17, 6:20:43 PM: Sean Reardon: you assign a network interface to a "zone" and you configure the zones
1/16/17, 6:20:48 PM: Linda Zheng: What is the network interface
1/16/17, 6:20:53 PM: Sean Reardon: (according to my flavor of firewall)
1/16/17, 6:21:24 PM: Sean Reardon: an interface would be like "ethernet" or "wifi"
1/16/17, 6:21:49 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh I see
1/16/17, 6:21:52 PM: Sean Reardon: (and "loopback" to handle things like 127.0.0.1 for the local host)
1/16/17, 6:22:08 PM: Linda Zheng: To be honest I don't really understand networking LOL are you go
1/16/17, 6:22:23 PM: Sean Reardon: will take maybe 15 more mins to test

1/16/17, 6:28:13 PM: Linda Zheng: Oops, why does it take so long to test? You said it takes 15+ min
1/16/17, 6:28:33 PM: Sean Reardon: ah
1/16/17, 6:28:48 PM: Sean Reardon: well, tore the whole thing down, and building it all up again
1/16/17, 6:28:53 PM: Sean Reardon: scripts takes about 15 mins

1/23/17, 12:56:52 PM: Linda Zheng: I think the pussy hats was supposed to be a play on words and actually look like cat ears
1/23/17, 12:57:01 PM: Linda Zheng: Which would make more sense
1/23/17, 12:59:12 PM: Linda Zheng: Aw the raped my wife confession was really sweet to me! he wanted her so much and then finally manipulated her into liking him as well! It
1/23/17, 1:00:14 PM: Linda Zheng: Ugh these overly sensitive people on Reddit are so overly sensitive about rape!
1/23/17, 3:03:05 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm liking the weather here as opposed to dc!
1/23/17, 3:04:16 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah! So much more. It's sunny here as opposed to raining and cloudy there
1/23/17, 3:06:01 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm glad you're home!
1/23/17, 3:06:11 PM: Sean Reardon: Nice to sleep in your own bed huh!!
1/23/17, 3:06:48 PM: Linda Zheng: OMG, yes so nice. My Sheets felt so nice on my skin
1/23/17, 4:58:58 PM: Linda Zheng: Coming home now!
1/23/17, 4:59:15 PM: Linda Zheng: Did your ups issue resolve some more?
1/23/17, 5:00:49 PM: Sean Reardon: new part is anticipated to show up around 8pm.  which is way better than previous estimate of tuesday morning
1/23/17, 5:01:13 PM: Sean Reardon: so, if it shows up at 8, then we probably have 4 or so hours to get the ups fixed
1/23/17, 5:01:25 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh yay! Then all you'll have to do is install it?
1/23/17, 5:01:36 PM: Sean Reardon: once it's fixed (say midnight) then we can bring the whole datacenter stack online
1/23/17, 5:01:47 PM: Sean Reardon: "install it" is probably many hours
1/23/17, 5:01:56 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh wow!
1/23/17, 5:02:00 PM: Sean Reardon: and once installed, we can attempt to bring stuff online
1/23/17, 5:02:16 PM: Sean Reardon: that operation will be split up amongst probably 4 people
1/23/17, 5:02:34 PM: Linda Zheng: What data do you guys store in house? As opposed to on aws or other clouds that you use?
1/23/17, 5:02:36 PM: Sean Reardon: and all working in parallel, if nothing goes wrong, will take around 3 to 4 hours to bring up and verify
1/23/17, 5:02:49 PM: Linda Zheng: That's so complicated!!
1/23/17, 5:02:50 PM: Sean Reardon: so maybe we're back to normal by tomorrow morning
1/23/17, 5:02:58 PM: Linda Zheng: Fingers crossed!
1/23/17, 5:04:12 PM: Sean Reardon: we store a handful of things in house:  exchange (email, calendar, that stuff... comes out to a couple terabytes), a whole bunch of "network share" files (ie, you browse the company network and find a random video of a company party from years back), and of course all of our p4 data
1/23/17, 5:04:27 PM: Sean Reardon: our p4 data is by far the biggest piece of the pie chart and certainly the most valuable
1/23/17, 5:06:03 PM: Sean Reardon: we run most of our local applications off of VMs that are hosted on hardware here.  those vmware VMs are house as datavolumes sitting in a couple big SAN storage devices
1/23/17, 5:06:42 PM: Sean Reardon: all of that data got hard stopped, so when we spin it up tonight we'll discover if it was corrupted in the hard crash
1/23/17, 5:17:50 PM: Sean Reardon: wanna get dindin with me??
1/23/17, 5:23:23 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh man! That's such stress!!

2/8/17, 11:01:00 AM: Linda Zheng: Ugh clash royale made me instantly infuriated!!!! I hate all the little boys who play this game!!!!!
2/8/17, 11:05:44 AM: Linda Zheng: This one little boy kicked me out randomly because he thought I didn't donate enough or good enough grounds in this season's clan chest. But I did donate enough and I didn't get enough crowns! And he was just a newcomer who got promoted to Chi! I hate this game and all the little stupid boys who play! Because if they saw me in real life if they knew me in real life they wouldn't be mean to me LOL
2/8/17, 11:09:16 AM: Linda Zheng: And now, because I got kicked out, at least I got invited back in by a real member of the clan, but now I don't get the crown chest reward even though I got the clan so many crowns
2/8/17, 11:33:54 AM: Sean Reardon: You're welcome in my clan!
2/8/17, 11:37:33 AM: Linda Zheng: Lol thanks. But I joined jimmys clan :P

2/8/17, 2:03:10 PM: Linda Zheng: That was your work email
2/8/17, 2:03:35 PM: Sean Reardon: loool
2/8/17, 2:03:36 PM: Sean Reardon: yeahhhh
2/8/17, 2:03:47 PM: Linda Zheng: Sorry!!!!
2/8/17, 2:03:48 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah!  I'll get packages!
2/8/17, 2:03:52 PM: Linda Zheng: Thanks!
2/8/17, 2:04:00 PM: Sean Reardon: no worries baby, madly in love with you :)
2/8/17, 2:05:01 PM: Linda Zheng: Is Jeff's team the people who "monitor" work emails and stuff like that?
2/8/17, 2:06:14 PM: Sean Reardon: no one monitors email
2/8/17, 2:06:17 PM: Sean Reardon: there's way too much
2/8/17, 2:06:40 PM: Sean Reardon: but if there was a need, he'd be able to go back and dig stuff up
2/8/17, 2:06:41 PM: Sean Reardon: no worries
2/8/17, 2:41:01 PM: Sean Reardon: do you have any sense of what flavor of linux c1 prefers?
2/8/17, 2:41:06 PM: Sean Reardon: centos, debian?
2/8/17, 2:52:38 PM: Linda Zheng: Umm I'm not sure
2/8/17, 2:52:43 PM: Sean Reardon: http://i.imgur.com/JaTe5Bb.jpg
2/8/17, 2:53:11 PM: Linda Zheng: Do you mean for employees computers? We only have Mac or Windows
2/8/17, 2:53:39 PM: Linda Zheng: For the aws ami, I think each team chooses which one they want to use
2/8/17, 2:54:14 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah for cloud :)
2/8/17, 2:54:30 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah i think each team/project chooses
2/8/17, 2:54:37 PM: Linda Zheng: I don't think there's a standard
2/8/17, 2:54:46 PM: Sean Reardon: makes sense
2/8/17, 2:54:59 PM: Linda Zheng: Because for my project, I think I just chose whatever one I was told to choose
2/8/17, 2:55:52 PM: Sean Reardon: which was what?
2/8/17, 3:56:39 PM: Linda Zheng: Yummm I forgot
2/8/17, 3:56:44 PM: Linda Zheng: I'll look it up
2/8/17, 4:05:19 PM: Linda Zheng: Do you know where to find that?
2/8/17, 4:05:32 PM: Linda Zheng: I looked on aws but it does not tell me the type of container it is
2/8/17, 4:06:32 PM: Sean Reardon: the name of the AMI ought to be a clue
2/8/17, 4:06:52 PM: Sean Reardon: no big deal, was just curious if c1 had an approved standard or something
2/8/17, 4:08:15 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah, I don't see any "ami"
2/8/17, 4:08:51 PM: Sean Reardon: np
2/8/17, 4:11:41 PM: Linda Zheng: Sorry, I just watched while someone helped me set up these ec2 instances and containers , so I don't know
2/8/17, 4:14:43 PM: Linda Zheng: But looking at all the AMIs that are used in the east dev aws account, it seems that "other Linux" and "red hat" are the 2 most popular choices
2/8/17, 4:14:51 PM: Linda Zheng: So I do t think there is a standard
2/8/17, 4:14:56 PM: Linda Zheng: *don't
2/8/17, 4:15:07 PM: Sean Reardon: otay
2/8/17, 4:15:21 PM: Linda Zheng: Ubuntu is popular as well

2/18/17, 12:43:33 PM: Linda Zheng: The double-muscling phenotype is a heritable condition resulting in an increased number of muscle fibers (hyperplasia), instead of the (normal) enlargement of individual muscle fibers (hypertrophy). Both the Belgian Blue and Piedmontese cattle breeds carry this myostatin mutation.

2/19/17, 2:32:15 PM: Linda Zheng: so then they desperately need / seek out gov assistance and support any psychopath who casually says that he will "give them jobs"
2/19/17, 3:59:56 PM: Sean Reardon: I can't tell if that sounds more liberal or conservative!

2/19/17, 4:04:05 PM: Linda Zheng: just the ones who make poor life choices that make them end up there
2/19/17, 4:04:12 PM: Sean Reardon: yep
2/19/17, 4:04:16 PM: Linda Zheng: sometimes life happens and everyone needs help
2/19/17, 4:04:57 PM: Linda Zheng: but sometimes, you can take actions and make better life choices
2/19/17, 4:05:05 PM: Linda Zheng: like not having children when you're still a child yourself
2/19/17, 4:06:25 PM: Linda Zheng: and I'm not hating on people for needing help; just the ones who choose to have children when they can't afford it, so they BECOME desperate and need help and vote for trump because they think he can help them

3/1/17, 8:28:54 PM: Linda Zheng: And we set up a dnd meetup some time in the  future!
3/1/17, 8:29:12 PM: Linda Zheng: It was kinda awk at times tbh
3/1/17, 8:29:29 PM: Linda Zheng: Because I don't really know any references
3/1/17, 8:30:57 PM: Linda Zheng: And I just didn't really know what to do or where to sit or stand
3/1/17, 8:31:11 PM: Linda Zheng: And i wasn't sure which version of me to be
3/1/17, 8:31:30 PM: Linda Zheng: So I kinda switched versions a lot and wasn't sure which to be for this environment.
3/1/17, 8:32:01 PM: Linda Zheng: At work, I was the work version of social Linda, and that one is really likeable and friendly and outgoing. But the regular social Linda is not very good
3/1/17, 8:32:31 PM: Linda Zheng: But I've decided to take up 3d printing as my next hobby!!!
3/1/17, 10:25:29 PM: Sean Reardon: Aww I totally get that
3/1/17, 10:27:32 PM: Linda Zheng: When I say "I forgot about you" and it feels awkward, it's because I don't know which version of Linda to be to interact with you! Do you get it now??
3/1/17, 10:46:59 PM: Sean Reardon: Haha that's an interesting insight!
3/1/17, 10:48:28 PM: Linda Zheng: Since I didn't have any lasting negative repercussions from gps spoofing Pokemon go last night, I'm gonna do it again tonight! Heeheehee

3/2/17, 12:28:31 PM: Linda Zheng: I just couldn't say no to so much peer pressure. Apparently, girls get 2 points when they score!

3/2/17, 3:09:06 PM: Linda Zheng: Let's compare when you get back!!
3/2/17, 3:09:10 PM: Sean Reardon: Rgr!
3/2/17, 3:09:20 PM: Sean Reardon: How'd your cheating go last night??
3/2/17, 3:09:34 PM: Linda Zheng: I only did gps spoofing because I was worried that you were going to be too far ahead!
3/2/17, 3:09:40 PM: Linda Zheng: Very well!
3/2/17, 3:09:53 PM: Linda Zheng: I always set my location to deep ellum and then walk around
3/2/17, 3:10:10 PM: Linda Zheng: Because it has a good mix of various Pokemon, stops and gyms
3/2/17, 3:10:19 PM: Linda Zheng: I got 4 gyms last night!
3/2/17, 3:10:22 PM: Sean Reardon: Hahaha you just like warp there then back afterwards?
3/2/17, 3:10:27 PM: Sean Reardon: Nice!
3/2/17, 3:11:19 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah the issue is, I encountered on the first night, if you use the spoofer to change location too quickly, Pokemon go doesn't allow you to catch any Pokemon , you can throw infinite Pokeballs, and you don't get items at pokestops
3/2/17, 3:12:06 PM: Linda Zheng: Like I first set it to deep ellum, okayed for an hour, then set it to a houndour nest. And Pokemon go just would not let me catch anything or get items
3/2/17, 3:12:06 PM: Sean Reardon: Ah like you're disconnected
3/2/17, 3:12:21 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah
3/2/17, 3:12:50 PM: Linda Zheng: And I was like oh nooooo. And I was too ashamed to tell you lolol. I just resolved to never play Pokemon again. It was quite a life altering moment.
3/2/17, 3:13:27 PM: Sean Reardon: Whoa!
3/2/17, 3:13:37 PM: Sean Reardon: That would be nuuuys
3/2/17, 3:13:40 PM: Sean Reardon: Nuts

3/2/17, 6:02:34 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahaha no I'm actually at zaza
3/2/17, 6:02:46 PM: Linda Zheng: I don't check in when I GPS spoof Pokemon go! :p
3/2/17, 6:09:28 PM: Sean Reardon: Gotta have *some* morales
3/2/17, 8:04:13 PM: Sean Reardon: Whatchu up to at zaza?
3/2/17, 9:30:08 PM: Linda Zheng: Well there's no benefit! Swarm doesn't help me catch more pokes!
3/2/17, 9:33:05 PM: Linda Zheng: Welce weekend dinner for the new candidates for July. Remember (probably not) last year when I went to Richmond c1 for a few days? It was that for the 2017 class. It was so weird and different from the other side! Much better than the first time. I was so nervous and awkward and tense that time and worried about making friends and scoping out "hmm which one will be a potential future friend???" So I was just really worried and felt so much stress the whole time and it was not a good time. But this time, it was just a chill hangout with friends!!
3/2/17, 9:33:40 PM: Linda Zheng: Like upon reflection, it all worked out!
3/2/17, 9:34:13 PM: Linda Zheng: With the whole friends situation lol. And now that I have a group of friends, I hardly ever hang out with them!
3/2/17, 9:34:57 PM: Linda Zheng: So I have resolved to hang out with friends more!
3/2/17, 9:36:11 PM: Linda Zheng: But it's just so much work. I was exhausted when I got home. Even thought it was fun, in the back of my mind, there's always the "ugh when I can go home and sit on couch and watch TV and get high", because doing nothing is always better than doing nothing
3/2/17, 9:36:19 PM: Linda Zheng: *something
3/2/17, 9:36:45 PM: Sean Reardon: Hahahah
3/2/17, 9:36:53 PM: Sean Reardon: I totally understand more how you feel
3/2/17, 9:36:59 PM: Sean Reardon: Than I usually do
3/2/17, 9:37:11 PM: Sean Reardon: So much social this week is killing me
3/2/17, 9:37:21 PM: Linda Zheng: Aww!!
3/2/17, 9:37:21 PM: Sean Reardon: So wishing I could just have couch
3/2/17, 9:37:25 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahaha
3/2/17, 9:37:33 PM: Linda Zheng: Even you have your limits!
3/2/17, 9:37:41 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah!!
3/2/17, 9:38:52 PM: Linda Zheng: In the past, when hanging out with friends in college, I'd always have the thought in the back of my mind, "ugh I just want to lay in bed and flirt with Christopher". And now I have you ❤️

3/28/17, 10:14:25 PM: Linda Zheng: I have misunderstood circle jerk till now:

Circle jerk is a reddit reference. It means a community where everybody comes and rants about the same thing. It is also a joke because reddit is in a sense a circlejerk anyways. It is basically a rant

3/29/17, 11:11:58 AM: Linda Zheng: AND HE WANTS TO CONTROL MY VIEWS AND ACTIONS STILL. TO BE JUST AS CONSERVATIVE AND SMALL MINDED AS HIM
3/29/17, 11:12:39 AM: Linda Zheng: I'm just not gonna come home anymore
3/29/17, 11:19:41 AM: Sean Reardon: Ew!  Oh no I'm so sorry!
3/29/17, 11:21:00 AM: Sean Reardon: That has to be super frustrating
3/29/17, 11:21:07 AM: Linda Zheng: IT IS!!!!
3/29/17, 11:21:10 AM: Sean Reardon: Okay, I'm not like him.  You're right
3/29/17, 11:21:41 AM: Linda Zheng: Ugh I wish hed either be a worse parent so I can hate him without feeling guilty
3/29/17, 11:21:49 AM: Linda Zheng: Or just be a better person so I can like him
3/29/17, 11:22:20 AM: Sean Reardon: Ha that's... kinda crazy insightful

3/29/17, 11:29:44 AM: Sean Reardon: Yes, you need your own room.
3/29/17, 11:30:12 AM: Linda Zheng: Yeah that's what he said when he was giving me his conservative lecture
3/29/17, 11:30:34 AM: Sean Reardon: Jeeez
3/29/17, 11:31:49 AM: Linda Zheng: Things like gay marriage, weed, gender-neutral bathrooms, etc. All the progress US has made as a country are "satanic". Like wtf. I hated him as a child because he didn't believe and God and caused my mom so much sadness. He can't just quote the Bible when lecturing me about his conservative, bigoted views.
3/29/17, 11:38:45 AM: Sean Reardon: Wow as a kid, he sucked because he wasn't Christian enough and now he sucks because he's too Christian.
3/29/17, 11:39:10 AM: Sean Reardon: He wouldn't get along with my mom at all
3/29/17, 11:43:56 AM: Linda Zheng: He's not even Christian !
3/29/17, 11:44:23 AM: Sean Reardon: You have to be super frustrated

3/29/17, 11:44:44 AM: Sean Reardon: You're strong, you'll get through this
3/29/17, 11:51:35 AM: Linda Zheng: My mom, who's historically been more strict and less permissive is finally better now, because she's accepted that I'm an adult and will make my own decisions regardless of what they think. My dad is just still trying to control my life!!!
3/29/17, 11:52:42 AM: Linda Zheng: The worst part is that he doesn't even know why I hate him now!!
3/29/17, 11:53:24 AM: Linda Zheng: Ugh okay </rant>. Time to leave. Thanks for letting me complain!

4/10/17, 4:48:49 PM: Sean Reardon: There aren't even pokestops out on the tarmac :(
4/10/17, 4:48:56 PM: Linda Zheng: I know :(
4/10/17, 4:49:37 PM: Linda Zheng: Do you think you'll have feelings for Jen again because she's back and you're hanging out with her child that you raised for so long?
4/10/17, 4:49:57 PM: Linda Zheng: I don't think I'm emotionally able to deal with ex gf and feelings like that
4/10/17, 4:50:15 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh wow, nope, I sure dont
4/10/17, 4:50:50 PM: Sean Reardon: I actually have "Oh my God what was I ever thinking" feelings for jen
4/10/17, 4:51:04 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahaha okay thanks!
4/10/17, 4:51:06 PM: Sean Reardon: Maya is not some sort of glue to entice me
4/10/17, 4:51:24 PM: Sean Reardon: Maya is more of a guilt than anything else anymore
4/10/17, 4:51:32 PM: Linda Zheng: Awww sorry
4/10/17, 4:51:38 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm just another guy in her life that disappeared
4/10/17, 4:51:51 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah that makes sense
4/10/17, 4:52:07 PM: Linda Zheng: Was just having some jealoisy feelings lol
4/10/17, 4:52:12 PM: Sean Reardon: I really do wish Maya could meet you
4/10/17, 4:52:19 PM: Sean Reardon: I'd love for her to see that I'm happy
4/10/17, 4:52:27 PM: Linda Zheng: Ugh deplaning now fml
4/10/17, 4:52:30 PM: Sean Reardon: I understand
4/10/17, 4:53:18 PM: Sean Reardon: Yep.  Once they have mechanical issues usually you gotta get new plane
4/10/17, 4:53:32 PM: Linda Zheng: Should I just give up?
4/10/17, 4:53:36 PM: Linda Zheng: Idk what to do
4/10/17, 4:53:50 PM: Sean Reardon: Ha if you're lucky maybe you'll miss the event and just enjoy zaza
4/10/17, 4:54:14 PM: Sean Reardon: You probably need direction from c1 people who are expecting you to be there
4/10/17, 4:54:42 PM: Linda Zheng: I asked them and they said just try to make it to the end of the event to talk about the tdp program
4/10/17, 4:54:57 PM: Sean Reardon: It ends at 9?
4/10/17, 4:55:53 PM: Sean Reardon: It's only an hour flight.  So if you can leave by 7ish, you could still make it (if it ends at 9)
4/10/17, 4:58:14 PM: Linda Zheng: It actually ends at 8:15 lol
4/10/17, 4:58:30 PM: Sean Reardon: Hm then 6ish
4/10/17, 4:58:39 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah :/
4/10/17, 4:59:16 PM: Sean Reardon: I think at like 630 if you haven't left yet you're justified in saying "so, can't make it, should I just go home?"
4/10/17, 4:59:23 PM: Sean Reardon: Unless you want to Zaza:)
4/10/17, 5:12:11 PM: Linda Zheng: Okay I'm coming home now
4/10/17, 5:12:18 PM: Linda Zheng: Next flight won't be until 740
4/10/17, 5:12:22 PM: Linda Zheng: Which is way too late
4/10/17, 5:12:23 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh nice!
4/10/17, 5:12:31 PM: Linda Zheng: Ugh this is the worst !
4/10/17, 5:12:46 PM: Sean Reardon: Such bad luck!!

4/10/17, 5:32:21 PM: Sean Reardon: Ugh
4/10/17, 5:50:05 PM: Linda Zheng: Lol this Uber driver just casually brings up "the Lord" in almost every topic he talks about
4/10/17, 5:50:45 PM: Sean Reardon: Does he look like jesus?
4/10/17, 5:51:01 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahaha not as much as you do :P
4/10/17, 5:51:06 PM: Sean Reardon: Jen is bad at phone, so haven't coordinated yet where to redirect.

4/12/17, 2:26:46 PM: Sean Reardon: When one player tweeted the support account to voice frustration at a well-known spoofer who's been flagged numerous times already, the official Niantic account replied to say:

"Thanks for reporting. We’re working to add functionality to stop spoofing, and your reports are helping us with our investigations."

Not only is this good news to have some proper feedback from Niantic with regards to spoofers in general, but the prospect of further functionality in the game to help rid the game of spoofers will no doubt be music to the ears of die-hard Pokemon GO players.
4/12/17, 2:29:30 PM: Linda Zheng: I haven't spoofed in weeks!
4/12/17, 2:29:56 PM: Linda Zheng: It's gonna be hard for them to detect spoofers though

4/30/17, 6:50:03 PM: Sean Reardon: Pizza :(
4/30/17, 6:50:17 PM: Linda Zheng: It's not that I don't like doing things or drinking or going to bars and doing new things I love having adventures! it's just that I don't enjoy socializing with other people for more than like 5 min at a time, or sharing your attention with people. It's just a lot of difficult and uncomfortable mental work.
4/30/17, 6:50:18 PM: Sean Reardon: Guess I can never have pizza again
4/30/17, 6:50:31 PM: Linda Zheng: Lol literally I'm watching Jenna marbles
4/30/17, 6:50:45 PM: Sean Reardon: I understand that.  I'm so glad you had fun
4/30/17, 6:50:52 PM: Sean Reardon: No more break up feelings
4/30/17, 6:50:54 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah! Thanks!
4/30/17, 6:51:02 PM: Sean Reardon: Glad we're secret engaged
4/30/17, 6:51:11 PM: Linda Zheng: Well I'm working through them
4/30/17, 6:51:15 PM: Sean Reardon: No-take-backs
4/30/17, 6:51:20 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahahahaga
4/30/17, 6:51:55 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh no!! The best pizza?? Maybe it's the the spiciness?
4/30/17, 6:52:39 PM: Sean Reardon: Maybe!
4/30/17, 8:29:52 PM: Linda Zheng: Ugh I miss you!!
4/30/17, 8:30:03 PM: Linda Zheng: Hope bill maher made it tonight!!

4/30/17, 9:31:26 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh yay!! Did your dad like him?
4/30/17, 9:32:01 PM: Sean Reardon: Yep!  Sure did
4/30/17, 9:32:14 PM: Sean Reardon: Wow our Uber driver doesn't like us at all
4/30/17, 9:32:31 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha maybe you're too white?
4/30/17, 9:36:44 PM: Sean Reardon: On our way home
4/30/17, 9:40:51 PM: Linda Zheng: I wonder what the little girl who sat next to you on the plane thought of us, lol
4/30/17, 9:41:14 PM: Linda Zheng: Because we have such a weird dialect!
4/30/17, 9:41:25 PM: Linda Zheng: We're so cute ❤️
4/30/17, 9:45:03 PM: Sean Reardon: Hahah
4/30/17, 9:45:08 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah I wonder
5/1/17, 2:23:57 PM: Linda Zheng: Omg! My team won an award! 🏆
5/1/17, 2:24:13 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh wow! How fun!
5/1/17, 2:24:22 PM: Sean Reardon: Do you get to go on stage?
5/1/17, 2:26:16 PM: Linda Zheng: It's like THE company award!
5/1/17, 2:26:37 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha no, but we get to have dinner with the CEO in dc in June

5/1/17, 2:30:00 PM: Sean Reardon: Hm
5/1/17, 2:30:08 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm super low energy
5/1/17, 2:30:15 PM: Linda Zheng: Like "what's the point of it all"
5/1/17, 2:30:20 PM: Sean Reardon: Getting an appointment for doc next week
5/1/17, 2:30:22 PM: Linda Zheng: Awww
5/1/17, 2:30:31 PM: Linda Zheng: Are you not feeling well physically?
5/1/17, 2:30:37 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah?  That sounds a little depressed
5/1/17, 2:30:50 PM: Sean Reardon: Do you want to talk about it?
5/1/17, 2:31:09 PM: Sean Reardon: I mean with me, but now that I say it, maybe a counselor?
5/1/17, 2:31:44 PM: Linda Zheng: I've been thinking about talking to a counselor, but it's so hard getting someone to understand
5/1/17, 2:32:00 PM: Linda Zheng: Because you have to start from scratch and explain your whole life
5/1/17, 2:32:10 PM: Linda Zheng: And who you are and how you think
5/1/17, 2:32:48 PM: Linda Zheng: We can talk about it! I liked talking with you in NYC that one night I fed you water :)
5/1/17, 3:08:55 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah I hear ya, hard to bring someone up to speed right?  And then once you have, because it was so effort full, you don't want to switch counselors.
5/1/17, 3:09:09 PM: Sean Reardon: I'd be happy to help you find someone?
5/1/17, 3:09:45 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah! I miss my black counselor at Rice lol
5/1/17, 3:10:12 PM: Sean Reardon: Aww
5/1/17, 3:10:34 PM: Linda Zheng: Mmm it's okay for now, I'll wait a few more weeks since the antidepressants need like 3 months before the full effect haha
5/1/17, 3:10:40 PM: Linda Zheng: Thank you though!
5/1/17, 4:07:48 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm just sit today
5/1/17, 4:09:32 PM: Linda Zheng: Yummm jelly!

5/1/17, 4:15:36 PM: Sean Reardon: Eh just low energy
5/1/17, 4:15:46 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm being a bump on a log
5/1/17, 4:26:03 PM: Linda Zheng: We need to watch John Oliver, silicon valley, Bob's burger today!

5/2/17, 6:28:04 PM: Linda Zheng: Life is
5/2/17, 6:28:22 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah?  feeling some ennui?
5/2/17, 6:28:29 PM: Sean Reardon: (do you like that word?)
5/2/17, 6:28:35 PM: Linda Zheng: Omg yes!! Haha I've forgotten that word!!
5/2/17, 6:29:10 PM: Sean Reardon: I can relate :/  I hate the blues
5/2/17, 6:29:17 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah :/
5/2/17, 6:29:27 PM: Linda Zheng: It's not even "sadness" the way it used to be
5/2/17, 6:29:32 PM: Sean Reardon: how much longer till you feel like the new meds ought to be working?
5/2/17, 6:29:34 PM: Sean Reardon: oh?
5/2/17, 6:29:41 PM: Sean Reardon: (you said it was months?)
5/2/17, 6:29:45 PM: Linda Zheng: Idk 3 months?
5/2/17, 6:29:49 PM: Sean Reardon: yikes
5/2/17, 6:29:51 PM: Sean Reardon: so long
5/2/17, 6:29:56 PM: Linda Zheng: But I don't think they'll help
5/2/17, 6:30:06 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe you're too realistic
5/2/17, 6:30:13 PM: Linda Zheng: I think I just need to accept that life is just this
5/2/17, 6:30:13 PM: Sean Reardon: like, too aware
5/2/17, 6:30:16 PM: Sean Reardon: like Rick is
5/2/17, 6:31:35 PM: Sean Reardon: what would you prefer it to be?
5/2/17, 6:42:47 PM: Linda Zheng: I'm not sure. I think life is just this. Boring repetitive loop. But I've always known that. Even even so, I've always looked forward to this time in my life (career, apartment, freedom, no obligations etc). And it my dream come true for a few months. But now it's just like "now what". When I didn't have this, o was sad because I didn't have the one thing I thought I wanted. But now that I do, and this is daily life, it's just become so monotmous. I don't have any more goals. I'm not even that motivated try hard at work because it's not like it'll get me anywhere meaningful. Maybe it'll get me promoted early. Which used to motivate me. But most likely not. Which is fine because I'll either find a new job next year or get promoted next year automatically even if I just do the bare minimum. So it's like I'm just wasting 8 hours a day sitting and being bored and reflecting on how meaningless life is and how I have no more goals. Which makes me super depressed coming home. Which makes me feel like I have to have weed to feel better. Which makes me even more depressed about life upon retrospection because I feel like I'm becoming dependent on weed. But maybe that's okay? Like if I just accept my life as it is now, and npt worry about how I have no passion or joy or motivation, then I'll be less sad about life. Maybe I'm seeking validation that passing each day meaninglessly is okay?
5/2/17, 6:42:55 PM: Linda Zheng: Sorry that was such a ramble
5/2/17, 6:48:24 PM: Linda Zheng: Maybe I should do what Nicholas is doing and study philosophy? Then I can understand human thoughts and life more and analyze life better
5/2/17, 6:49:12 PM: Linda Zheng: To answer the question "why do things?"
5/2/17, 6:51:32 PM: Sean Reardon: I can relate.. that whole spiral thing is something I struggle with
5/2/17, 6:51:46 PM: Sean Reardon: As I suck the more I dislike myself the more I suck etc
5/2/17, 6:52:00 PM: Linda Zheng: Awww
5/2/17, 6:52:43 PM: Linda Zheng: But you don't feel that anymore, right?
5/2/17, 6:52:51 PM: Linda Zheng: I thought that was just when you were young
5/2/17, 6:53:11 PM: Sean Reardon: I have that weird "I bet I can do this" thing that motivates me.  Hadn't really thought about that until we spoke about it the other day
5/2/17, 6:53:30 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh yeah! You talked about that!
5/2/17, 6:53:48 PM: Linda Zheng: That's a good motivation!
5/2/17, 6:53:57 PM: Linda Zheng: Like any motivation is good motivation
5/2/17, 6:53:56 PM: Sean Reardon: I think I've had that weird itch for a long while, but it nearly always bites me in the ass
5/2/17, 6:54:23 PM: Linda Zheng: But do you ask why it matters whether or not you achieve it?
5/2/17, 6:55:52 PM: Linda Zheng: Or does it just matter intrinsically, because it's "supposed" to matter?
5/2/17, 6:56:13 PM: Linda Zheng: I'm not sure
5/2/17, 6:56:41 PM: Sean Reardon: It's not fun to fail!  My motivation is never (rarely?) to just dick around
5/2/17, 6:56:59 PM: Linda Zheng: But if you don't try, you don't fail
5/2/17, 6:57:01 PM: Sean Reardon: I always want to achieve some goal, however silly it is
5/2/17, 6:57:18 PM: Sean Reardon: So when I very-nearly-always fail it sucks
5/2/17, 6:58:23 PM: Sean Reardon: I really think I get excited about like proving something
5/2/17, 6:58:31 PM: Linda Zheng: But I mean like, why do anything? Why not just die?
5/2/17, 6:58:42 PM: Sean Reardon: Like, I bet if I can pull this off people will see me different
5/2/17, 6:58:50 PM: Sean Reardon: Ha right
5/2/17, 6:58:52 PM: Sean Reardon: Shrug
5/2/17, 6:58:55 PM: Sean Reardon: Less fun
5/2/17, 6:59:02 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah, I get that. Those are good feelings
5/2/17, 6:59:22 PM: Sean Reardon: THAT feeling was definitely a high school feeling for me
5/2/17, 7:00:02 PM: Linda Zheng: The trying or the dying feeling?
5/2/17, 7:00:53 PM: Sean Reardon: The *why try* feeling
5/2/17, 7:01:15 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah I see!
5/2/17, 7:01:33 PM: Linda Zheng: Was that Trevor?
5/2/17, 7:03:19 PM: Sean Reardon: Hm.  Kinda?  Yeah guess so?  Like so realistic that everything felt senseless
5/2/17, 11:25:19 PM: Sean Reardon: Omw home but my uber really needs to pee, lol
5/2/17, 11:25:35 PM: Sean Reardon: Gonna find a gas station

5/3/17, 11:49:51 AM: Sean Reardon: isn't it nice to know we already got our pokes for the day??

5/3/17, 11:50:37 AM: Linda Zheng: No I didn't!!! Remember???
5/3/17, 11:50:57 AM: Linda Zheng: My phone was in abdifferent time last night and it didn't say "first Pokemon of the day"
5/3/17, 11:51:26 AM: Sean Reardon: but it did continue streak with the pokestop
5/3/17, 11:51:39 AM: Linda Zheng: It didn't!

5/10/17, 2:05:03 PM: Sean Reardon: But you were real crying.
5/10/17, 2:05:27 PM: Sean Reardon: I pulled my cock out of your mouth because the other girl wanted to kiss you
5/10/17, 2:05:44 PM: Sean Reardon: You had fear in your eyes, you didn't want that
5/10/17, 2:05:52 PM: Sean Reardon: Then started crying
5/10/17, 2:06:27 PM: Sean Reardon: I should have used the dad voice to calm you and tell you to be pretty for me
5/10/17, 2:09:05 PM: Linda Zheng: You want to be pretty don't you?
5/10/17, 2:09:20 PM: Linda Zheng: I liked how you parented me part night and touched my butt :)

5/10/17, 2:22:16 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh no, I don't like that. Is that why I cried?
5/10/17, 2:28:48 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah!  You could see her coming in for a kiss and were afraid I was going to pull my cock out of your mouth to allow it
5/10/17, 2:28:54 PM: Sean Reardon: When I did you started crying
5/10/17, 2:28:57 PM: Sean Reardon: 😓
5/10/17, 2:29:30 PM: Linda Zheng: Aww poor girl
5/10/17, 2:30:14 PM: Sean Reardon: dream was hyper real
5/10/17, 2:30:27 PM: Sean Reardon: the girl who wanted to kiss you was a random blonde girl
5/10/17, 2:30:44 PM: Sean Reardon: she wasn't into girls, but was sorta committed to throwing herself into the event
5/10/17, 2:31:02 PM: Sean Reardon: she wanted us both to have a good time, she was sort of a pleaser
5/10/17, 2:31:05 PM: Linda Zheng: What a good sport!

5/10/17, 2:31:57 PM: Sean Reardon: all three of us knew you'd be the least comfortable
5/10/17, 2:32:24 PM: Sean Reardon: but I wasn't really pampering you.  was kinda going for it in hopes to motivate you to go for it too
5/10/17, 2:32:54 PM: Sean Reardon: next was that you were both going to go doggy style for me side by side and I could swap back and forth at will, ugh
5/10/17, 2:32:54 PM: Sean Reardon: was so hot
5/10/17, 2:33:01 PM: Sean Reardon: wish I hadn't woken up

5/10/17, 2:40:13 PM: Sean Reardon: no kissing between you two
5/10/17, 2:40:26 PM: Sean Reardon: but I want to kiss her while I look down on you sucking my cock
5/10/17, 2:40:26 PM: Sean Reardon: may I kiss her?
5/10/17, 2:55:40 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh no!
5/10/17, 2:55:56 PM: Linda Zheng: My limits are people limit 2 :(
5/10/17, 3:00:13 PM: Sean Reardon: I remember she was sucking my cock, and I put your hand on her head, and you enjoyed pushing her head down to make her gag while we were having face intimacies and watching her
5/10/17, 3:00:25 PM: Sean Reardon: drats.  guess I need a different two girls
5/10/17, 3:00:37 PM: Sean Reardon: no worries, you're just not cut out for it

5/10/17, 3:08:02 PM: Linda Zheng: I'll settle for being pretty
5/10/17, 3:09:14 PM: Linda Zheng: I was going to suggest while you're having a different 2 girls, I could have a different boy
5/10/17, 3:09:57 PM: Linda Zheng: But then I was like "nah, I'll just settle for being pretty"
5/10/17, 3:10:27 PM: Sean Reardon: hm, maybe if we could choose those other boys/girls
5/10/17, 3:10:46 PM: Sean Reardon: actually nah.  I don't want any two random girls
5/10/17, 3:10:51 PM: Linda Zheng: Hmm but I don't have any choices
5/10/17, 3:11:09 PM: Sean Reardon: I think I'm only really interested in having you there

5/10/17, 3:29:56 PM: Sean Reardon: I don't want to use all your vacation up
5/10/17, 3:59:00 PM: Linda Zheng: Is it too late if we leave after work ? Like no one keeps track of vacation officially, but I don't want to seem like I'm gone too often lol. Like, keeping up appearances

5/11/17, 10:24:07 AM: Linda Zheng: Haha keep putting dick in!
5/11/17, 10:25:52 AM: Sean Reardon: Oh maybe.  But her mouth would be much too small.
5/11/17, 10:26:21 AM: Sean Reardon: Maybe when you feed her you can frequently push your fingers down her throat to get her used to it?
5/11/17, 10:55:16 AM: Linda Zheng: Aww so smol
5/11/17, 10:55:28 AM: Linda Zheng: Like for a while, she won't even be able to take a finger
5/11/17, 10:55:49 AM: Linda Zheng: But o think I would have competition with her about who is cutest and smollest
5/11/17, 10:56:02 AM: Linda Zheng: I like being cutest and smollest :/
5/11/17, 10:56:15 AM: Linda Zheng: That's my identity
5/11/17, 11:16:02 AM: Sean Reardon: You'll always be cutest
5/11/17, 11:16:16 AM: Sean Reardon: And she'll have white genes so she'll eventually be bigger than you
5/11/17, 11:29:21 AM: Sean Reardon: Oh no I was walking across the apartment.  And my pajamas weren't tied.  So they fell down.

"Oh no" because if you'd seen you'd have fallen apart with laughter.  Feel bad that you missed out.
5/11/17, 11:39:47 AM: Linda Zheng: Hahahahahahahaaoh my gosh!!!!!!!
5/11/17, 11:40:04 AM: Linda Zheng: They fell down????? Omg I'm so sad to have missed that!!!!!!!
5/11/17, 11:40:13 AM: Linda Zheng: That's the ultimate Linda humor
5/11/17, 11:41:58 AM: Sean Reardon: Oh *I* didn't fall
5/11/17, 11:42:02 AM: Sean Reardon: Just pants
5/11/17, 11:56:39 AM: Linda Zheng: Hahahah yeah that's still super funny!!!!
5/11/17, 11:56:46 AM: Linda Zheng: It wouldn't be funny if you fell
5/11/17, 11:57:00 AM: Linda Zheng: Because you're an adult and it's not cute or make me feel evil
5/11/17, 11:57:07 AM: Linda Zheng: But it's funny that pants fell!!!
5/11/17, 12:27:41 PM: Linda Zheng: Omg so intense

5/11/17, 12:55:10 PM: Sean Reardon: Do you think we ought to give you lots of ambien and try anal before you're 23?
5/11/17, 1:01:00 PM: Linda Zheng: I don't think we ought
5/11/17, 1:01:08 PM: Linda Zheng: I still have a few more good years left!
5/11/17, 1:01:39 PM: Linda Zheng: Maybe we ought to before then?
5/11/17, 1:01:44 PM: Sean Reardon: Let's not reject it out of hand
5/11/17, 1:02:11 PM: Linda Zheng: Okay, we can keep it in our arsenal
5/11/17, 1:02:38 PM: Sean Reardon: Which are you most anxious of:  pain or mess?
5/11/17, 1:03:03 PM: Linda Zheng: Mess and icky-ness!
5/11/17, 1:03:19 PM: Linda Zheng: Pain is okay because it's temporary
5/11/17, 1:03:31 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh!  Then don't worry, you won't have any memory so no shame!
5/11/17, 1:04:03 PM: Linda Zheng: But you will!
5/11/17, 1:04:14 PM: Linda Zheng: And I'll know that
5/11/17, 1:04:22 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh you think I'll judge you?  Hm.
5/11/17, 1:04:25 PM: Linda Zheng: It just won't be the same
5/11/17, 1:04:29 PM: Linda Zheng: Afterwards
5/11/17, 1:04:33 PM: Sean Reardon: There need not be mess
5/11/17, 1:04:39 PM: Sean Reardon: Ask Nicholas!
5/11/17, 1:04:44 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahahahahaha
5/11/17, 1:08:05 PM: Sean Reardon: What if I like you more?  What if I'm more turned on my how slutty my little girl is?
5/11/17, 1:11:07 PM: Linda Zheng: Hmmmm I like that I think
5/11/17, 1:11:12 PM: Linda Zheng: But there's too much risk
5/11/17, 1:11:45 PM: Linda Zheng: In my mind, it's like 99% chance of shame, and 1% more love
5/11/17, 1:12:23 PM: Sean Reardon: In my mind it's the other way around.  Also!
5/11/17, 1:12:57 PM: Sean Reardon: Additional risk of feeling like it's never gonna happen, and I'll just always be denied
5/11/17, 1:13:52 PM: Sean Reardon: Maybe it's best if you don't know and one day I reveal that it's been happening and it's why I'm so much more infatuated with you
5/11/17, 1:14:50 PM: Linda Zheng: I guess so!
5/11/17, 1:15:00 PM: Linda Zheng: If tbworks out that way
5/11/17, 1:15:09 PM: Sean Reardon: Yeah!
5/11/17, 1:15:28 PM: Sean Reardon: Then and only then we can have anal while you're conscious
5/11/17, 1:15:37 PM: Sean Reardon: It would also be real rape!
5/11/17, 1:15:42 PM: Sean Reardon: Win win
5/11/17, 1:16:57 PM: Linda Zheng: True!
5/11/17, 1:17:11 PM: Linda Zheng: Kill 2 birds with 1 stone
5/11/17, 1:17:32 PM: Linda Zheng: But idk if I'll ever be drugged enough to forget such a traumatic experience!
5/11/17, 1:17:45 PM: Sean Reardon: I think so
5/11/17, 1:17:51 PM: Linda Zheng: Do you think you're more horny today because I cock teased you?

6/5/17, 8:35:33 PM: Linda Zheng: "In fact, I am quite disappointed by the fact that the payment information entered on The Ablon portal could not automatically be transferred to The Civic portal. It even seems to be hosted on the same site! The transition of property manager should not have impact on the current resident living experience. "
6/5/17, 8:35:46 PM: Linda Zheng: is it okay to say that to the civic people?
6/5/17, 8:36:30 PM: Linda Zheng: LOLOL that old people facebook post was hilair
6/5/17, 8:38:12 PM: Sean Reardon: totally fair to say :)
6/5/17, 8:39:14 PM: Linda Zheng: im so annoyed with the civic already! no longer 5 stars
6/5/17, 8:40:08 PM: Sean Reardon: long live ablon
6/5/17, 10:56:09 PM: Linda Zheng: I miss you boyfriend.
6/5/17, 10:56:31 PM: Linda Zheng: Not to be clingy but what time do you expect to be home and cuddle me?
6/5/17, 10:59:10 PM: Sean Reardon: ugh sorry!  have formatting to do
6/5/17, 10:59:22 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe you can help me?  you're so much better at data is beautiful
6/5/17, 10:59:37 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh what would you like me to dovv

6/6/17, 10:46:19 AM: Sean Reardon: Thank you for corn yesterday!
6/6/17, 3:45:49 PM: Linda Zheng: How are the users looking?
6/6/17, 3:55:34 PM: Sean Reardon: not so bad!  strict medium
6/6/17, 3:55:53 PM: Sean Reardon: PC users are swarming, higher counts than in a long while
6/6/17, 3:56:22 PM: Sean Reardon: ps4 and xbox are right now up to about where they were this weekend, which is pretty good given that it's a random tuesday
6/6/17, 3:56:26 PM: Sean Reardon: thanks for asking!
6/6/17, 3:56:33 PM: Sean Reardon: how are you?
6/6/17, 3:58:16 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh nice nice!! So good results for first day??
6/6/17, 4:08:06 PM: Sean Reardon: I guess?  found a server crash and will silently deploy a new server, both linux and windows, by eod.  that's pretty fun
6/6/17, 4:09:46 PM: Sean Reardon: we *might* be above the line for revenue?  will know more in a couple days.  hard to guess at the moment because we don't really know the conversion rate for these sorts of users
6/6/17, 4:23:14 PM: Sean Reardon: are you coming home in time to get quip?  or should I get there before 5?
6/6/17, 4:54:55 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha sneak in a fix before users notice?
6/6/17, 4:55:25 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh you mean just because you have many users, doesn't mean they'll all buy stuff?
6/6/17, 4:55:25 PM: Sean Reardon: yep!
6/6/17, 4:55:44 PM: Sean Reardon: yep!  not sure how this demographic will behave
6/6/17, 4:55:49 PM: Linda Zheng: Quip is in mail box so I can get it when I get back
6/6/17, 4:56:06 PM: Linda Zheng: What's the demographic like?
6/6/17, 4:56:06 PM: Sean Reardon: definitely suspect early curious users will sniff and leave
6/6/17, 4:57:52 PM: Sean Reardon: very high on PC!
6/6/17, 4:57:54 PM: Sean Reardon: surprisingly so
6/6/17, 5:11:59 PM: Sean Reardon: hahah http://gizmodo.com/253334/hotdoll-the-sex-doll-for-dogs
6/6/17, 5:28:13 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahahaha nice nice

6/6/17, 5:40:05 PM: Linda Zheng: Hmm maybe a bit later!
6/6/17, 5:41:35 PM: Sean Reardon: lindsey b-day tonight - do you want to go?  I kinda want to go, so long as it's nearish
6/6/17, 5:54:58 PM: Linda Zheng: Sure when/where?
6/6/17, 5:56:36 PM: Sean Reardon: guessing hibachi, but she hasn't suggested anything yet concrete
6/6/17, 5:57:18 PM: Linda Zheng: That's pretty close!
6/6/17, 6:02:19 PM: Linda Zheng: What time ?
6/6/17, 6:36:14 PM: Linda Zheng: Sean
6/6/17, 6:37:17 PM: Sean Reardon: hi!  sorry sorry, think it's 730 as per other thread
6/6/17, 6:37:35 PM: Linda Zheng: You know how for URL encoding, space becomes %20, and * becomes %2A, etc
6/6/17, 6:37:39 PM: Sean Reardon: so you can lay :)
6/6/17, 6:37:42 PM: Linda Zheng: What type of encoding is that?
6/6/17, 6:37:47 PM: Sean Reardon: hm I'm aware of that
6/6/17, 6:37:51 PM: Linda Zheng: Is that utf-8?
6/6/17, 6:37:53 PM: Sean Reardon: hm lemme see
6/6/17, 6:38:31 PM: Linda Zheng: like this webpage https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/dencoder/
6/6/17, 6:39:09 PM: Linda Zheng: "*#$&(@" encoded becomes "%2A%23%24%26%28%40"
6/6/17, 6:39:28 PM: Linda Zheng: i want that encoding name
6/6/17, 6:39:35 PM: Sean Reardon: have you asked google?
6/6/17, 6:39:49 PM: Sean Reardon: it's not mime encoding.. lemme check
6/6/17, 6:39:50 PM: Linda Zheng: yeah, but im not sure if it's right
6/6/17, 6:39:54 PM: Linda Zheng: i think it's utf-8
6/6/17, 6:40:34 PM: Linda Zheng: like this page explains what the different encodings are https://stackoverflow.com/questions/213506/java-net-urlencoder-encodestring-is-deprecated-what-should-i-use-instead
6/6/17, 6:40:54 PM: Linda Zheng: but i still don't really know if that is the "right" encoding for URLs
6/6/17, 6:41:09 PM: Sean Reardon: it's not utf-8
6/6/17, 6:41:27 PM: Sean Reardon: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_urlencode.asp
6/6/17, 6:41:37 PM: Sean Reardon: it's specific to urls in browsers
6/6/17, 6:41:50 PM: Sean Reardon: utf-8 predates browsers
6/6/17, 6:42:04 PM: Linda Zheng: but the chart below seems like it is utf-8
6/6/17, 6:43:10 PM: Linda Zheng: i just need to encode special characters, like !@#$%^&*()
6/6/17, 6:43:12 PM: Linda Zheng: and space
6/6/17, 6:43:19 PM: Linda Zheng: letters and numbers don't need encoding
6/6/17, 6:43:57 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah, that sounds awful like the link I sent
6/6/17, 6:43:59 PM: Linda Zheng: im always confused by this
6/6/17, 6:44:07 PM: Sean Reardon: utf-8 allows all those special characters and space
6/6/17, 6:44:21 PM: Linda Zheng: okay, i'll just try utf-8
6/6/17, 6:44:25 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah, it's actually a fairly confusing space unless you study it all the time
6/6/17, 6:44:28 PM: Linda Zheng: and try again if it doesn't work lol
6/6/17, 6:44:47 PM: Sean Reardon: "!@#$%^&*()" is utf-8
6/6/17, 6:45:14 PM: Sean Reardon: if you're just trying different encodings maybe attempt MIME64
6/6/17, 6:45:40 PM: Sean Reardon: it's pretty non-threatening for the wire
6/6/17, 6:45:59 PM: Linda Zheng: but the server needs to decode whatever i encoded
6/6/17, 6:46:12 PM: Linda Zheng: so im not sure if the server will decode with utf-8 or mime64
6/6/17, 6:46:25 PM: Linda Zheng: it should be decoding with the standard url decoder, but im not sure what that uses
6/6/17, 6:47:32 PM: Sean Reardon: if you know what is going to decode it, and you can't change that, then all you can use is that same method to encode
6/6/17, 6:47:37 PM: Sean Reardon: no need to try different methods
6/6/17, 6:48:00 PM: Sean Reardon: not sure what that's called exactly.. the link I sent you called it "percent encoding"
6/6/17, 6:48:10 PM: Sean Reardon: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding
6/6/17, 6:48:51 PM: Linda Zheng: Yes! That's the type of encoding in looking for!
6/6/17, 6:48:50 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah seems like you're talking about percent encoding
6/6/17, 6:49:12 PM: Linda Zheng: But it doesn't have a name recognizable by the Java encoding class
6/6/17, 6:49:13 PM: Sean Reardon: woo!
6/6/17, 6:49:20 PM: Sean Reardon: so excited to know if it works!
6/6/17, 6:49:29 PM: Linda Zheng: So was wondering if that's the same as utf-8
6/6/17, 6:49:34 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah, can't find a common term for it
6/6/17, 6:49:39 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh well I will try several things
6/6/17, 6:49:40 PM: Sean Reardon: def not utf-8
6/6/17, 6:49:42 PM: Linda Zheng: Thanks!
6/6/17, 6:49:48 PM: Sean Reardon: gimme a list of other encodings
6/6/17, 6:49:57 PM: Sean Reardon: may recognize it or cross off others
6/6/17, 6:50:42 PM: Linda Zheng: I'm driving home now. Will try tonight or tomorrow lol
6/6/17, 6:52:41 PM: Sean Reardon: drive safely love
6/6/17, 6:54:41 PM: Linda Zheng: Will you come home to pick me up before going over to Hibachi?
6/6/17, 6:55:22 PM: Sean Reardon: of course!  just be cute and I'll handle the rest.  like what your married life could be.
6/6/17, 7:04:25 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha I do like being cute relying on other people to do things for me
6/6/17, 7:05:11 PM: Sean Reardon: I love it when you rely on me!  also when you're cute.

6/7/17, 2:29:00 PM: Linda Zheng: NOICE!
6/7/17, 2:31:20 PM: Linda Zheng: Did the issue with only having PvP get resolved?
6/7/17, 2:39:45 PM: Sean Reardon: Still gathering evidence.  Feel like one bug fixed, but linux may well be shakey for a bit
6/7/17, 4:34:16 PM: Sean Reardon: how are you doing lb?

6/8/17, 10:45:30 AM: Linda Zheng: I don't think that will help with the Wi-Fi issue
6/8/17, 10:46:06 AM: Sean Reardon: But maybe we'll be less internet addicted and learn how to appreciate the here and now
6/8/17, 10:47:44 AM: Linda Zheng: I don't think that's possible in this day and age
6/8/17, 10:54:29 AM: Linda Zheng: Can we go to summer moon coffee and Zhang's kitchen sometime again?

6/15/17, 4:45:32 PM: Sean Reardon: making up bullshit
6/15/17, 4:45:56 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahaha about what?
6/15/17, 4:48:24 PM: Sean Reardon: it's this weird thing where you're expected to take it seriously, and HR will badger you until you do it, but really I just don't want anything to change.  and if I wanted something to change, I wouldn't do it through some webform.  I'd probably like take the person out and talk to them
6/15/17, 4:50:23 PM: Linda Zheng: Can you just have short descriptions along the lines of "all is good"?
6/15/17, 4:50:45 PM: Linda Zheng: Omg there's so many people in the pool making so much noise outside!!!!
6/15/17, 4:51:03 PM: Sean Reardon: aww let me run home and we can have a bit of cuddle maybe?
6/15/17, 4:51:27 PM: Sean Reardon: you can tell me about your day and ignore the outside noise
6/15/17, 4:51:33 PM: Linda Zheng: I won't say no to cuddles! But I was looking forward to doing more plotting!
6/15/17, 4:52:01 PM: Linda Zheng: But maybe we can have some cuddles and then sit somewhere quieter and work together individually!
6/15/17, 4:54:08 PM: Sean Reardon: oh you do more plotting!  inspiration is rare, grab it when it strikes!
6/15/17, 4:54:27 PM: Sean Reardon: use cutie patootie big headphones to drown out annoying people
6/15/17, 4:55:45 PM: Linda Zheng: okay!
6/15/17, 4:55:51 PM: Linda Zheng: let's have some cuddles before we leave though
6/15/17, 4:56:02 PM: Sean Reardon: I won't say no to cuddles!
6/15/17, 4:56:10 PM: Linda Zheng: hahaha
6/15/17, 5:02:03 PM: Linda Zheng: you about the political parties, you meant the party that has slight majority in congress, right?
6/15/17, 5:02:08 PM: Linda Zheng: not the party of the president?
6/15/17, 5:03:19 PM: Sean Reardon: yes, the one that has slight majority in congress
6/15/17, 5:03:37 PM: Linda Zheng: and congress = house + senate

6/16/17, 2:02:47 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah, kinda doesn't seem like it's a thing either of us would be into, but curious why on earth the pettys are
6/16/17, 2:03:07 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah!  that's what I'm about
6/16/17, 2:03:12 PM: Linda Zheng: But maybe they wanted to do it with just their brother
6/16/17, 2:03:17 PM: Sean Reardon: I hope you don't have fomo!
6/16/17, 2:03:23 PM: Sean Reardon: nope, asked for us both!

6/16/17, 2:04:09 PM: Linda Zheng: Ugh so conflicted!
6/16/17, 2:05:23 PM: Sean Reardon: stress!
6/16/17, 2:06:09 PM: Sean Reardon: I'll get a ticket, and if you change your mind, I'll ping other folks to see if they want to go - does that work for you?
6/16/17, 2:06:22 PM: Sean Reardon: it's $100 for the ticket, VIP I guess!
6/16/17, 2:06:28 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe VIP is less chaotic
6/16/17, 2:06:35 PM: Linda Zheng: Okay!!
6/16/17, 2:06:41 PM: Linda Zheng: Thanks!!

6/19/17, 6:02:57 PM: Linda Zheng: OMG, that was such a good creative idea
6/19/17, 6:05:38 PM: Linda Zheng: Does he have anymore ideas?
6/19/17, 6:06:08 PM: Linda Zheng: I don't have any ideas!

6/19/17, 6:08:42 PM: Sean Reardon: he's super smart
6/19/17, 6:13:47 PM: Linda Zheng: Lol yeah I need an intro project to learn the basics of the framework and language before i can work with him and be useful, I think lol
6/19/17, 6:14:16 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm sure he'd love to help
6/19/17, 6:16:15 PM: Linda Zheng: I think first Im going to try to create a watchOS util that vibrates or beeps when it disconnects from iPhone, apparently that's not a feature yet for some reason
6/19/17, 6:16:44 PM: Linda Zheng: But it won't be very popular because the population of people with Apple watch is much smaller than the population of people with iPhone
6/19/17, 6:18:51 PM: Sean Reardon: don't gotta be popular
6/19/17, 6:18:57 PM: Sean Reardon: just something to learn
6/19/17, 6:19:15 PM: Linda Zheng: True true
6/19/17, 6:23:11 PM: Sean Reardon: seriously do just a little bit and then I'll connect you to mcgarry
6/19/17, 6:23:14 PM: Sean Reardon: it would be great
6/19/17, 6:23:48 PM: Linda Zheng: But I DK if I'll be able to help him at all or be useful to him
6/19/17, 6:24:02 PM: Sean Reardon: he so won't care
6/19/17, 6:24:05 PM: Linda Zheng: Like his music stuff seems really advanced and I don't know anything about sound waves or music
6/19/17, 6:24:58 PM: Linda Zheng: OK, I'll get started and then ask him for tips and advice LOL
6/19/17, 6:25:09 PM: Sean Reardon: seriously he'd love that

6/21/17, 2:29:15 PM: Linda Zheng: I'm okay! Sorry about being emotional last night in the middle of the night lol
6/21/17, 2:29:32 PM: Linda Zheng: Also, I think topo Chico arrived! Can you pick it up?

6/21/17, 5:41:31 PM: Linda Zheng: Love you too
6/21/17, 6:06:49 PM: Linda Zheng: I'm sorry that my default reaction to your coughing at night is annoy/anger/breakup, rather than empathy/love, which is what I think you would feel towards me, and how one should feel towards someone they love. Which makes me feel that I'm just not capable of compassion/love/selflessness. Which makes me feel the break up feelings even more. 

But during the day time, all those negative feelings and "reasons to break up" from the night are completely gone. The only residual feeling is guilt/worry for making such a big deal out of something so minor and being so emotional about it.
6/21/17, 6:22:29 PM: Sean Reardon: I thought about it this morning.  I came away thinking that it wasn't surprising.  It's a thing you do and have in you.  Somehow I've incorporated that into my understand of you, and it's easy for me to see that, on the balance, you're still really amazing and I'm still really happy being your boyfriend
6/21/17, 6:23:03 PM: Linda Zheng: Awww that's so sweet, thank you for loving me still
6/21/17, 6:24:20 PM: Linda Zheng: I'm sorry that I'm not more loving and compassionate :(. You're so loving and kind to me

6/24/17, 3:02:04 PM: Sean Reardon: I think I have this so fucked up, lol
6/24/17, 3:07:25 PM: Linda Zheng: hahaha nice!!

6/24/17, 3:08:43 PM: Linda Zheng: how did you fuck it up last time and why do you think you're so close again?
6/24/17, 3:10:27 PM: Sean Reardon: I couldn't remember if I'd installed dropbox as a system wide tool or as a user tool (just under seanr)
6/24/17, 3:10:50 PM: Sean Reardon: so I'd updated the fuck out of seanr's version but it didn't matter because the system was starting it from /opt (system wide)
6/24/17, 3:11:12 PM: Linda Zheng: hahahaha
6/24/17, 3:11:26 PM: Linda Zheng: so now you have to update the fuck out of that one
6/24/17, 3:11:29 PM: Sean Reardon: but once that worked it turns out I'd configured the automatic startup to work on a wholly different user, which I'd forgotten even existed
6/24/17, 3:11:39 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah, but now I'm good at updating
6/24/17, 3:13:28 PM: Linda Zheng: haha oh no!!
6/24/17, 3:13:35 PM: Linda Zheng: so many difference dropboxes!
6/24/17, 3:13:42 PM: Sean Reardon: right??
6/24/17, 3:13:56 PM: Sean Reardon: definitely deleted the wrong ones once I knew what was what!
6/24/17, 3:14:04 PM: Sean Reardon: (hope I got the right one!)
6/24/17, 3:15:06 PM: Sean Reardon: also had a couple different "how to install dropbox" sites I was reading from, and had to re-discover which one I'd used last time
6/24/17, 3:15:14 PM: Sean Reardon: subtle configuration differences!
6/24/17, 3:16:40 PM: Linda Zheng: yeah
6/24/17, 3:16:55 PM: Linda Zheng: now that you found the right one, it's all downhill from here!

6/24/17, 3:26:15 PM: Sean Reardon: it's not even backup (at all) but I kinda think of it that way

6/28/17, 4:35:56 PM: Linda Zheng: ohhh no!!!!
6/28/17, 4:36:04 PM: Linda Zheng: that's probably why the name sounded familiar!!!!
6/28/17, 4:36:18 PM: Sean Reardon: but maybe it was a different place??
6/28/17, 4:36:55 PM: Linda Zheng: i looked at the list of nearby sushi places on google, and this one stood out, because the name was familiar. because i thought i had remembered it from the ad. but the memory was from that event
6/28/17, 4:37:20 PM: Linda Zheng: then idk
6/28/17, 4:37:40 PM: Linda Zheng: did lindsey say it was new?
6/28/17, 4:38:02 PM: Sean Reardon: hm, no - it was a place I recommended, off a recommendation from jeff

7/7/17, 5:17:35 PM: Linda Zheng: Totes
7/7/17, 5:26:03 PM: Sean Reardon: jimmy now says that he has lisa with him, so its up to you if you want to join us for dinner (and dinner location hasn't been decided, so you can influence!)
7/7/17, 5:26:23 PM: Sean Reardon: also, if you want alone time where you can reflect on how weird you were last night, totally cool too
7/7/17, 5:31:03 PM: Linda Zheng: I don't think I was being too out of the ordinary for me weird but i am sorry that I annoyed you and kept you up with my movements and that I tried to interact with you while you were sleeping
7/7/17, 5:31:42 PM: Linda Zheng: We can talk about your feelings about my actions later if you want
7/7/17, 5:32:01 PM: Linda Zheng: What time were you guys thinking for din din?

7/7/17, 5:34:30 PM: Sean Reardon: 7pm bottled in bond
7/7/17, 5:34:33 PM: Sean Reardon: that work?
7/7/17, 5:43:57 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha I think I perceive dad voice when I feel like Im being out of the ordinary annoying/irritating/bad
7/7/17, 5:44:13 PM: Linda Zheng: Which I felt, since you'd already given me a few warnings
7/7/17, 5:47:52 PM: Sean Reardon: that's so interesting!
7/7/17, 5:48:21 PM: Sean Reardon: you behaved so differently than normal and I kinda liked it but was kinda weirded out
7/7/17, 5:48:50 PM: Sean Reardon: when I said "hey let's just stay up and have dr pepper" I was being serious
7/7/17, 5:48:59 PM: Sean Reardon: but I really didn't sleep the night before so I was so tired!
7/7/17, 5:49:06 PM: Sean Reardon: was so interesting
7/7/17, 5:49:16 PM: Sean Reardon: I wondered if you had a bad medicine interaction even
7/7/17, 5:53:52 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh! I thought you were being angrily sarcastic when you said that! 
Aww I'm so sorry for keeping you up :(. I was just super energetic for some reason, mentally and physically, maybe because I worked too hard lol. And anxious about falling asleep while not being able to. Which made me hyper sensitive to all the feelings of the bed and random sounds
7/7/17, 5:54:18 PM: Sean Reardon: you were so interesting!  you became creepy catherine
7/7/17, 5:54:56 PM: Sean Reardon: ablon loading bay at 7, jimmy and lisa pick us up and we go to bottled in bond
7/7/17, 5:56:02 PM: Linda Zheng: I think it was medicine related! Because I kept forgetting to pick up antidepressants this week, and this type of weird energy thing happens often when I stop taking antidepressants for a few days in a row all of a sudden
7/7/17, 5:56:23 PM: Linda Zheng: And I didn't have enough weed to make me pass out
7/7/17, 5:57:05 PM: Linda Zheng: How was it interesting? Like interesting in what way? It's not a typical mode for me to be in lolol
7/7/17, 5:59:50 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah, interesting in that it was not at all a "typical mode for you to be in"
7/7/17, 6:00:11 PM: Sean Reardon: it was surprising and new
7/7/17, 6:00:31 PM: Sean Reardon: i was solidly irritated but also feeling like more in love?
7/7/17, 6:00:37 PM: Sean Reardon: if that makes sense?
7/7/17, 6:09:56 PM: Linda Zheng: By the time that we started spending nights together regularly, I'd adapted to relying on drugs for sleeping and other things, so bed time didn't have a chance to make itself known as a problem area. But historically, without drugs, sleeping/bedtime is like THE main daily stressor/issue! It's one of the reasons I hated all my roommates, skipped classes, and became generally antisocial during college.
7/7/17, 6:12:29 PM: Sean Reardon: whaaaa
7/7/17, 6:12:31 PM: Sean Reardon: no
7/7/17, 6:12:48 PM: Sean Reardon: we'd done so many phone sleeps together way before any of that
7/7/17, 6:12:55 PM: Sean Reardon: you slept a-okay those times
7/7/17, 6:13:09 PM: Sean Reardon: well, maybe I'm misremembering
7/7/17, 6:13:23 PM: Sean Reardon: I recall you snoring maybe as many times as you recall me snoring
7/7/17, 6:14:31 PM: Sean Reardon: I didn't realize you had such a thing with sleep!
7/7/17, 6:14:38 PM: Sean Reardon: omg we definitely need ambien!
7/7/17, 6:15:25 PM: Linda Zheng: I think a lot of the times we had phone sleeps I had already switched to relying on drugs, or I was in a good sleeping environment or was nocturnal. Because mostly phone sleeps were either during senior year of college, or summers
7/7/17, 6:15:48 PM: Sean Reardon: ah, yeah, that may be
7/7/17, 6:15:56 PM: Sean Reardon: I liked weirdo linda!
7/7/17, 6:15:59 PM: Sean Reardon: she was super weird!
7/7/17, 6:16:21 PM: Linda Zheng: I think the weirdest part I'm feeling is how weird you feel about it!
7/7/17, 6:16:24 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha
7/7/17, 6:16:28 PM: Sean Reardon: lol
7/7/17, 6:16:40 PM: Sean Reardon: dude you got up on your knees and just stared at me!
7/7/17, 6:16:44 PM: Sean Reardon: fucking weird!
7/7/17, 6:16:55 PM: Sean Reardon: I really did kinda like it
7/7/17, 6:17:14 PM: Linda Zheng: Some times I sit up! Like out of frustration or because the bed is too itchy on my skin
7/7/17, 6:17:19 PM: Sean Reardon: like I found a new feature I didn't know my software did
7/7/17, 6:17:23 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahahahaga
7/7/17, 6:17:25 PM: Sean Reardon: yeah, I do the same!
7/7/17, 6:17:33 PM: Sean Reardon: the night before I was doing that
7/7/17, 6:17:40 PM: Sean Reardon: just sat up and reddit for a while
7/7/17, 6:17:58 PM: Linda Zheng: Like a new bug whose code path is so buried and rare that it rarely gets executed anymore!
7/7/17, 6:19:00 PM: Sean Reardon: ha, yeah maybe that's closer.  I dunno, I was really torn last night between irritated and infatuated
7/7/17, 6:19:05 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah Reddit is calming, because by the time I resort to Reddit, I'd already given up on sleeping that night, so I'm less anxious about getting to sleep, which makes it easier to sleep
7/7/17, 6:19:18 PM: Sean Reardon: did you actually read anything when I told you to?
7/7/17, 6:19:31 PM: Sean Reardon: was that when I used dad voice?
7/7/17, 6:19:38 PM: Sean Reardon: I wish I could hear it from your ears!
7/7/17, 6:19:46 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha awww ❤️ that's like unbelievable true love
7/7/17, 6:20:35 PM: Linda Zheng: I did! I read a book Nicholas told me to read because he said that the main character was cute and did things like me! But she wasn't really similar to me all that much, so then I Reddited
7/7/17, 6:21:05 PM: Linda Zheng: Haha yes! It was when you used dad voice lololol
7/7/17, 6:21:55 PM: Sean Reardon: haha wow
7/7/17, 6:22:27 PM: Sean Reardon: if you'd said "yeah, let's get up and have adventure" I'm pretty sure I would have taken you up on it
7/7/17, 6:22:40 PM: Sean Reardon: "lets do adderall and go play disc golf!" etc
7/7/17, 6:23:08 PM: Linda Zheng: Aww we could have played more of our game!
7/7/17, 6:23:30 PM: Sean Reardon: haha
7/7/17, 6:24:39 PM: Linda Zheng: If command.seriousness >= seriousness.max - seriousness.threshold, then it's dad voice
7/7/17, 6:24:52 PM: Linda Zheng: Otherwise it's Sean voice
7/7/17, 6:25:10 PM: Sean Reardon: is there a < side of the coin?
7/7/17, 6:27:35 PM: Linda Zheng: But the command.seriousness value is set by Linda Object, so it depends on the previous commands Linda Object has received
7/7/17, 6:28:27 PM: Sean Reardon: Mmmm like some machine learning going on and such
7/7/17, 6:28:37 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah!
7/7/17, 6:29:07 PM: Sean Reardon: you home yet?

7/9/17, 4:57:26 PM: Linda Zheng: I don't think Trump supporters have any particular views on policy (foreign or domestic). They're moved only by a nihilistic hatred of liberals. Whatever riles them up is their bread and butter. They feel they've been mocked and ridiculed by popular culture (and that is half unfair and half deserved). So they are in the process of getting back at everyone. They elected Trump *because* he's a pig, because he can lay the biggest and steamiest piles on that mainstream culture. You have to pay attention, but if you follow interviews of Trump supporters, you will eventually notice that, from news clip to news clip, the one comment that comes back often is the one where the supporter will say something along the lines: "I like it when Trump shakes the media a little bit". These are the hardcore Trump fans. Sadly, the moderates are not far off. The stupidity of this situation is that everybody gets fooled. Trump first. Because he doesn't like his supporters (let's be real: this guy wouldn't wipe his ass with the hillbillies that follow him). But he thinks they like him. They don't. They elected him to do one thing: being a dick, especially to the liberal side of America. Eventually, Trump will get tired of being the people's monkey. And the people are getting fooled too. Some, I think, imagine Trump can both play the part and fix their lives. I don't believe their reasons to believe that are very sophisticated. You can narrow it to one thing: Trump is a billionaire so he must "know money", as one Trump supporter put it. The thing is he doesn't, his business track record proves it. I remember the speech of Michael Bloomberg at the DNC Convention. He said: "Trump says he wants to run America like he runs his business. God help us!". So Trump supporters won't get any out of him. What they are getting instead is the Republican agenda which, as far as I can remember, as always been about making sure poor people are miserable as hell. In the end, everybody will get tired of this farce. The administration is testing the limits of how far lies can go. But even stupidity as its limits sometimes. People will see that things aren't getting better and it will erode their patience and diminish their confidence. Trump too will tire of being the circus act. He'll realize he's the clown and not the show runner. He's gonna find himself in the situation of the performer who sees his audience getting bored and dwindle when he strays from his main trick. That will hurt his ego badly, his ego being, as we know, his soft spot. And beyond that, I think he did not anticipate that the press would be all up in his junk, asking for tax returns and peeling apart every shred of his business. If reporters start getting really specific about the underbelly of his so called empire Trump will get super squeamish. The tax returns in particular are a big no no. I don't think they'll show anything nefarious (they're tax returns after all), but I do believe they'll show he's not a billionaire, or at least that his wealth is vastly inflated. He's for sure very rich, but he's not *super* rich. If that became public, it would take a lot away from the Trump persona, at least in his eyes. Remember, he's the guy who sued because someone called him a millionaire (instead of a "billionaire"), as if that was somehow an insult. The suit may be a stunt, but the message is quite clear. The sum total of this is, I think, that Trump will drop the presidency like a hot potatoe. All this, of course, will take time. By then, as you said, it will be too late for people to realize that they have not only shot themselves in the foot but sawed their own legs off. It will be a hard reckoning and I can't think of how people will react. Maybe it will be very quiet suddenly, like when you turn the light off somewhere. But that's in the distance. For now, we have to get used to the noise. And, by God, we have to get better at parsing through that noise, to distinguish what is just people yelling and what is the loud cracks of the system crashing. Because when Trump is gone, and his supporters have followed him in that pit of shame and oblivion, we'll have a heavy work ahead of us. So we'd better start now to save on the sweat waiting for us. EDIT: Holy Moses! Thanks for the gold!

7/13/17, 4:55:49 PM: Linda Zheng: I enjoyed turning you on with my body and then putting it inside this morning ^_^
7/13/17, 4:58:52 PM: Sean Reardon: you just outright seduced me!
7/13/17, 5:00:15 PM: Linda Zheng: You took dick out!
7/13/17, 5:00:56 PM: Sean Reardon: you placed hand on ass!
7/13/17, 5:01:43 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah, I'm pretty seductive
7/13/17, 5:02:00 PM: Sean Reardon: mmmHmmm
7/13/17, 5:32:13 PM: Linda Zheng: I'm really confused about adult stuff
7/13/17, 5:32:35 PM: Linda Zheng: Like when I got my wisdom teeth extracted, the insurance company paid like all of it
7/13/17, 5:34:50 PM: Linda Zheng: But now, they just sent me a check for 1.4k..... Which is like almost the whole price of the wisdom teeth extraction minus around 500 which they labled at "patient responsibility", for a total of 1.9k which is how much the entire procedure cost, which they have already paid
7/13/17, 5:35:04 PM: Linda Zheng: So I didn't pay the patient responsibility, in addition, they sent me a check
7/13/17, 5:35:24 PM: Linda Zheng: Like do they think that I paid it and are now reimbursing me??
7/13/17, 5:38:16 PM: Sean Reardon: they sent you a check?  like you could deposit it in your bank?
7/13/17, 5:38:26 PM: Linda Zheng: yeah!
7/13/17, 5:39:34 PM: Linda Zheng: they sent me the amount which is labelled "delta dental pays"
7/13/17, 5:40:55 PM: Sean Reardon: wild
7/13/17, 5:41:01 PM: Sean Reardon: i'm confused about adult stuff too :(
7/13/17, 5:41:18 PM: Sean Reardon: maybe we should schedule a meeting with my dad and let him look it all over
7/13/17, 5:41:45 PM: Linda Zheng: LOLOL no it’s okay, i don’t wanna bother him with minor issues
7/13/17, 5:42:17 PM: Sean Reardon: you totally don't understand, he'd *love* it

7/16/17, 9:47:28 PM: Sean Reardon: Maybe we have thyroid problems that will make us huge
7/16/17, 9:47:52 PM: Linda Zheng: my grandma has thyroid problems and she's super skinny despite eating a lot!

7/17/17, 1:52:25 PM: Linda Zheng: Do you consider yourself to be an experienced driver?
7/17/17, 1:52:51 PM: Sean Reardon: Nope!  Prefer to stay humble and learn every day
7/17/17, 1:53:18 PM: Linda Zheng: Hahahaha not I. I like to already be the best

7/17/17, 3:12:26 PM: Sean Reardon: https://privacy.com/
7/17/17, 3:13:47 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh I just had a good idea! When we send each other links, let's give a brief description of why we sent it!
7/17/17, 3:14:14 PM: Linda Zheng: To answer the question "what do you want me to see from this"
7/17/17, 3:14:47 PM: Linda Zheng: Like your "this was a good read" was an acceptable description for the link you sent
7/17/17, 3:14:58 PM: Linda Zheng: But don't use that for every link!
7/17/17, 3:15:09 PM: Linda Zheng: For example:
7/17/17, 3:15:29 PM: Linda Zheng: Zip line and slide

7/17/17, 3:16:00 PM: Linda Zheng: I sent that link to Nicholas and said "for the cute boys and how fun it looks"
7/17/17, 3:18:25 PM: Linda Zheng: So that we don't miss the other's point for sending it!
7/17/17, 3:18:31 PM: Linda Zheng: Good idea??
7/17/17, 3:26:41 PM: Linda Zheng: Wow, privacy app seems like a good idea! But seems like a hassle as well to set them up and stuff. And also, the privacy app company becomes the one point of failure
7/17/17, 4:35:03 PM: Sean Reardon: Omw home!
7/17/17, 4:36:39 PM: Linda Zheng: Appointment went well?v
7/17/17, 5:20:00 PM: Sean Reardon: Yep, nothing alarming.  Time for more bloodwork I guess.  They also took a bunch of biopsies, guess I'll get those reports in a few weeks
7/17/17, 5:20:07 PM: Sean Reardon: Glad to be home :)
7/17/17, 5:39:24 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh good good
7/17/17, 5:39:46 PM: Linda Zheng: Oh like you were supposed to do the bloodwork earlier ?
7/17/17, 5:39:56 PM: Linda Zheng: Yeah! Welcome home!
7/17/17, 5:40:31 PM: Linda Zheng: I was scared last night! So I just kept Netflix on all night lolol

7/19/17, 12:11:36 PM: Sean Reardon: I think you might be right.  Build the human automation thing ourselves.  Realized last night that the right interface may well be a slack chatbot
7/19/17, 12:12:31 PM: Sean Reardon: Then the "human code" scripts can live in a pigeon language in p4 and get revisioning and such, and the interface can evolve easily
7/19/17, 12:12:38 PM: Sean Reardon: Thanks for the inspiration!
7/19/17, 12:14:48 PM: Linda Zheng: What's p4?
7/19/17, 12:14:57 PM: Sean Reardon: Perforce

7/20/17, 8:42:44 PM: Linda Zheng: You're actually the worst ever and I'm so angry at you right now and I don't want to date you anymore. I don't want to take care of an alcoholic drunk man in his 40's. Like actually get your shit together. You're way too experienced of a drinker to get this drunk this often without it being an actual issue.
7/20/17, 8:44:29 PM: Linda Zheng: You threw up on the floor and all over the bed and threw up in your sleep and choked on it for like half an hour and it happened multiple times.
7/20/17, 8:47:27 PM: Linda Zheng: I wish I didn't move to the ablon because it just makes it way too easy for you to just get drunk and go home. So I thought of moving. But moving is a hassle and I don't want to deal with all that.
7/20/17, 8:47:53 PM: Linda Zheng: But that shouldn't even be a consideration when choosing an apartment.
7/20/17, 8:49:21 PM: Linda Zheng: You're the worst and I actually hate you right now and I don't think I can get over the negative feelings I've felt towards you tonight and the other nights you've done this.
7/20/17, 8:55:46 PM: Linda Zheng: It's not just you. I just don't have a caring bone in my body. So when you come home drunk and not well and laying on the floor, I don't feel instinctive care for you. I can force the feelings to come, but they're not natural. You keep forcing me to have to care for you. In addition, I hate germs dirtiness, and you just threw up all over the floor and bed and that makes me the angriest.
7/20/17, 8:59:23 PM: Linda Zheng: I think you should just live at your house and we should only see each other when we want to instead of just being near each other all the time.
7/20/17, 8:59:35 PM: Linda Zheng: At least for a while
7/20/17, 9:00:29 PM: Linda Zheng: I wish we didn't have such a good morning together, and I also wish we could have that moment back.
7/20/17, 9:16:23 PM: Linda Zheng: You're the worst roommate I've ever had. Because at least the rest of them didn't throw up on the floor or bed because they were too drunk. Or was too drunk to even unlock the door. I wish I hadn't let you and and deal with this mess
7/20/17, 9:24:01 PM: Linda Zheng: I also hate how much you sucked at putting the couch together.
7/21/17, 7:24:26 AM: Linda Zheng: Hope you're still alive. You're the worst
7/21/17, 7:55:57 AM: Linda Zheng: Also, your glasses are at my place
7/21/17, 10:14:50 AM: Sean Reardon: I'm the worst, and I'm blind.
7/21/17, 10:16:57 AM: Sean Reardon: Just asked Mark "why am I here?" He says "picked you up from Linda's, she called us"  huh
7/21/17, 10:17:03 AM: Sean Reardon: Guess I was obnoxious
7/21/17, 10:17:51 AM: Linda Zheng: You threw up all over the bed and floor
7/21/17, 10:17:59 AM: Sean Reardon: Oh no!!
7/21/17, 10:18:07 AM: Linda Zheng: And you just kept throwing up and becoming unconscious
7/21/17, 10:18:11 AM: Linda Zheng: And I hated you so much
7/21/17, 10:18:20 AM: Linda Zheng: And I sent you a bunch of angry mean messages
7/21/17, 10:18:29 AM: Linda Zheng: But then deleted them off your phone
7/21/17, 10:18:30 AM: Sean Reardon: Ugh that's the worst I'm so sorry
7/21/17, 10:18:37 AM: Sean Reardon: Ha thank you :)
7/21/17, 10:18:57 AM: Linda Zheng: Please clean up the table, floor and bed of the taped area
7/21/17, 10:19:04 AM: Linda Zheng: And do the laundry
7/21/17, 10:19:12 AM: Linda Zheng: But I don't want to see you tonight
7/21/17, 10:19:13 AM: Sean Reardon: For sure!
7/21/17, 10:19:28 AM: Sean Reardon: :( okay
7/21/17, 10:19:49 AM: Sean Reardon: I think my eyeball is scratched
7/21/17, 10:20:25 AM: Linda Zheng: Sorry
7/21/17, 10:20:54 AM: Linda Zheng: Maybe don't be so drunk next time all the time on random weekdays
7/21/17, 10:21:47 AM: Sean Reardon: Feels like a good lesson
7/21/17, 10:23:59 AM: Linda Zheng: I'm mostly angry at you because you made my sacred place dirty and gross.
7/21/17, 10:24:30 AM: Sean Reardon: Did you sleep on the couch?
7/21/17, 10:27:34 AM: Linda Zheng: Next, I'm angry because you're so irresponsible with drinking. Like as a 40 year old man who's been drinking for over a decade, you should not be getting black out drunk as often as you do, unless it's actually becoming a problem. Why can't you just have a handful or so of drinks with friends like a handful of times a month??
7/21/17, 10:32:58 AM: Linda Zheng: I think it is because you have basically evaded any real responsibilities all your life that men your age usually have. Such as wife and kids. And you've become bored with life, so alcohol is a fun escape. Which I totally get
7/21/17, 10:33:18 AM: Linda Zheng: But that doesn't mean you have to get black out drunk so often
7/21/17, 10:36:31 AM: Linda Zheng: I'm only angry at you about that because I actually like you and I want to be with you for a long time and alcohol is so damaging to one's body. I think that the heartburn and other issues you've been having is due at least in part to your excessive alcohol use.
7/21/17, 10:36:46 AM: Linda Zheng: Anyway, I'm glad you're okay.
7/21/17, 10:37:48 AM: Sean Reardon: I think the alcohol is at least part of the throat issues too
7/21/17, 10:40:54 AM: Linda Zheng: I'm not going to be nor want to be a caring wifely figure who stands by your side and enables you to become more and more alcoholic. Because 1) caring doesn't come instinctively, and 2) I'm too young to deal with all this shit.
7/21/17, 10:41:14 AM: Sean Reardon: Ha fair on both counts
7/21/17, 10:41:23 AM: Linda Zheng: What did you even do yesterday?
7/21/17, 10:41:58 AM: Sean Reardon: Hung out with Jeff and Stacie at mattitos.
7/21/17, 10:51:51 AM: Linda Zheng: Sorry I involved Sammy. I just didn't know what to do with you because you were dying in bed and on the floor.
7/21/17, 10:53:01 AM: Sean Reardon: Thank you for reaching out to them.  They liked that you were comfortable enough to ask for help
7/21/17, 10:53:07 AM: Sean Reardon: So do I
7/21/17, 10:53:55 AM: Sean Reardon: How do you mean dying?
7/21/17, 10:58:11 AM: Linda Zheng: Like you kept choking on your throw up and gargling on it and throwing up all over the place!!
7/21/17, 11:00:37 AM: Linda Zheng: Like every 15-30 min
7/21/17, 11:00:47 AM: Linda Zheng: While in and out of consciousness!
7/21/17, 11:01:02 AM: Linda Zheng: I hated you for putting that much responsibility on me
7/21/17, 11:03:38 AM: Sean Reardon: :/  sometimes we have to care for each other.  Wish it wasn't for something sooo lame.  But still.
7/21/17, 11:06:10 AM: Linda Zheng: I know, caring is difficult for me as is. Especially when it's something self-inflicted and totally could have been avoided.
7/21/17, 11:08:34 AM: Sean Reardon: Lol I love your taped off area
7/21/17, 11:12:51 AM: Linda Zheng: Sorry Sean, I don't think I can give you the care and nurture you need, or that you give to me
7/21/17, 11:59:55 AM: Linda Zheng: Sorry for being mean to you just now. I just had so much anger and feelings from last night.
7/21/17, 12:01:18 PM: Sean Reardon: I understand.  You're certainly justified.
7/21/17, 12:15:32 PM: Linda Zheng: I think I want to be with you tonight actually
7/21/17, 12:15:41 PM: Linda Zheng: If you want to
7/21/17, 12:18:21 PM: Sean Reardon: I do!
7/21/17, 1:40:36 PM: Linda Zheng: Do you want to break up?
7/21/17, 1:41:07 PM: Linda Zheng: I want to forget that last night happened and go back to yesterday morning
7/21/17, 1:48:57 PM: Sean Reardon: I certainly don't want to break up
7/21/17, 1:49:42 PM: Linda Zheng: But it's hard to remove the negative images of you from my mind. And it's hard to forget the feelings of anger and disappointment I felt towards you. Which makes me feel bad because you just needed someone to take care of you. While I tired my best to help you, I was mostly angry that you were so irresponsible and got so drunk again, causing you to get the bed and ground and table dirty.
7/21/17, 1:51:04 PM: Sean Reardon: I'm sorry I disappointed you.
7/21/17, 1:53:02 PM: Linda Zheng: It's not just that
7/21/17, 1:56:06 PM: Linda Zheng: It's mostly that you used to be SO cool in my eyes. I did have you on a pedestal. I think that in order for a relationship to work, there has to some of that to an extent. You have to think that the person you're in a relationship with is different and better than other people. Otherwise, why would you want to stay with them, and not be with other people?
7/21/17, 6:32:23 PM: Sean Reardon: https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6ona2m/nasa_needs_you_space_agency_to_crowdsource/ maybe you could help!

7/29/17, 9:09:25 PM: Linda Zheng: this makes me so sad and worried :(
7/29/17, 9:10:45 PM: Linda Zheng: especially this part: "Your short term memory becomes more and more impaired. You become more and more paranoid. You become more and more content with wherever you are in life. You stop feeling any way other than the way cannabis makes you feel. You don't feel scared. You don't feel sad. You also don't feel excitement or joy or love. You just feel silly and relaxed, forever. I should know. I've smoked cannabis every day, multiple times a day for the past decade. It started out as a magical experience that was all about self-discovery, exploring my consciousness, creativity, love, and experimentation. However, after thousands and thousands of highs, it gradually became less and less about exploration and more and more about retreating inside of myself to an extremely familiar comfort zone where I always knew exactly what to expect."
7/29/17, 9:11:34 PM: Sean Reardon: Oh no!  Let's rehab
